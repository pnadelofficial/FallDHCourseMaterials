 The <CARDINAL>Two</CARDINAL> Sieges and Final Conquest of the City by the Latins.
 Schism of the Greeks.
 The restoration of the <NORP>Western</NORP> empire by <PERSON>Charlemagne</PERSON> was speedily followed by the separation of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> and <NORP>Latin</NORP> churches.
 (1) A religious and national animosity still divides the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> largest communions of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> world; and the schism of Constantinople, by alienating her most useful allies, and provoking her most dangerous enemies, has precipitated the decline and fall of the <PERSON>Roman</PERSON> empire in the East.
 Their aversion to the Latins.
 In the course of the present History, the aversion of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> for the <NORP>Latins</NORP> has been often visible and conspicuous.
 It was originally derived from the disdain of servitude, inflamed, after the time of Constantine, by the pride of equality or dominion; and finally exasperated by the preference which their rebellious subjects had given to the alliance of the Franks.
 In every age the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> were proud of their superiority in profane and religious knowledge: they had <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> received the light of Christianity; they had pronounced the decrees of the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> general councils; they alone possessed the language of <WORK_OF_ART>Scripture</WORK_OF_ART> and philosophy; nor should the Barbarians, immersed in the darkness of the West, (2) presume to argue on the high and mysterious questions of theological science.
 Those <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> despised in then turn the restless and subtile levity of the Orientals, the authors of every heresy; and blessed their own simplicity, which was content to hold the tradition of the apostolic church.
 Yet in the seventh century, the synods of Spain, and afterwards of France, improved or corrupted the <NORP>Nicene</NORP> creed, on the mysterious subject of the <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> person of the Trinity.
 (3)Procession of the Holy Ghost.
 In the long controversies of the East, the nature and generation of the <PERSON>Christ</PERSON> had been scrupulously defined; and the well-known relation of father and son seemed to convey a faint image to the human mind.
 The idea of birth was less analogous to the Holy Spirit, who, instead of a divine gift or attribute, was considered by the <NORP>Catholics</NORP> as a substance, a person, a god; he was not begotten, but in the orthodox style he proceeded.
 Did he proceed from the Father alone, perhaps by the Son? or from the Father and the Son? The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> of these opinions was asserted by the Greeks, the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> by the Latins; and the addition to the <NORP>Nicene</NORP> creed of the word filioque, kindled the flame of discord between the <NORP>Oriental</NORP> and the <NORP>Gallic</NORP> churches.
 In the origin of the disputes the <PERSON>Roman</PERSON> pontiffs affected a character of neutrality and moderation: (4) they condemned the innovation, but they acquiesced in the sentiment, of their <NORP>Transalpine</NORP> brethren: they seemed desirous of casting a veil of silence and charity over the superfluous research; and in the correspondence of <PERSON>Charlemagne</PERSON> and <PERSON>Leo</PERSON> the Third, the pope assumes the liberality of a statesman, and the prince descends to the passions and prejudices of a priest.
 (5) But the orthodoxy of <GPE>Rome</GPE> spontaneously obeyed the impulse of the temporal policy; and the filioque, which <PERSON>Leo</PERSON> wished to erase, was transcribed in the symbol and chanted in the liturgy of the Vatican.
 The <NORP>Nicene</NORP> and <NORP>Athanasian</NORP> creeds are held as the <NORP>Catholic</NORP> faith, without which none can be saved; and both <NORP>Papists</NORP> and <NORP>Protestants</NORP> must now sustain and return the anathemas of the Greeks, who deny the procession of the Holy Ghost from the Son, as well as from the Father.
 Variety of ecclesiastical discipline.
 Such articles of faith are not susceptible of treaty; but the rules of discipline will vary in remote and independent churches; and the reason, even of divines, might allow, that the difference is inevitable and harmless.
 The craft or superstition of <GPE>Rome</GPE> has imposed on her priests and deacons the rigid obligation of celibacy; among the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> it is confined to the bishops; the loss is compensated by dignity or annihilated by age; and the parochial clergy, the papas, enjoy the conjugal society of the wives whom they have married before their entrance into holy orders.
 A question concerning the <PERSON>Azyms</PERSON> was fiercely debated in the eleventh century, and the essence of the Eucharist was supposed in the <LOC>East</LOC> and <LOC>West</LOC> to depend on the use of leavened or unleavened bread.
 Shall I mention in a serious history the furious reproaches that were urged against the Latins, who for a long while remained on the defensive? They neglected to abstain, according to the apostolical decree, from things strangled, and from blood: they fasted (a <NORP>Jewish</NORP> observance!) on the Saturday of each week: during the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> week of Lent they permitted the use of milk and cheese; (6) their infirm monks were indulged in the taste of flesh; and animal grease was substituted for the want of vegetable oil: the holy chrism or unction in baptism was reserved to the episcopal order: the bishops, as the bridegrooms of their churches, were decorated with rings; their priests shaved their faces, and baptized by a single immersion.
 Such were the crimes which provoked the zeal of the patriarchs of Constantinople; and which were justified with equal zeal by the doctors of the <NORP>Latin</NORP> church.
 (7) Ambitious quarrels of Photius, patriarch of Constantinople, with the popes, A.
D.
 857-886.
 Bigotry and national aversion are powerful magnifiers of every object of dispute; but the immediate cause of the schism of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> may be traced in the emulation of the leading prelates, who maintained the supremacy of the old metropolis superior to all, and of the reigning capital, inferior to none, in the <NORP>Christian</NORP> world.
 About the middle of the ninth century, Photius, (8) an ambitious layman, the captain of the guards and principal secretary, was promoted by merit and favour to the more desirable office of patriarch of Constantinople.
 In science, even ecclesiastical science, he surpassed the clergy of the age; and the purity of his morals has never been impeached: but his ordination was hasty, his rise was irregular; and Ignatius, his abdicated predecessor, was yet supported by the public compassion and the obstinacy of his adherents.
 They appealed to the tribunal of Nicholas the First, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the proudest and most aspiring of the <PERSON>Roman</PERSON> pontiffs, who embraced the welcome opportunity of judging and condemning his rival of the East.
 Their quarrel was embittered by a conflict of jurisdiction over the king and nation of the Bulgarians; nor was their recent conversion to <NORP>Christianity</NORP> of much avail to either prelate, unless he could number the proselytes among the subjects of his power.
 With the aid of his court the <NORP>Greek</NORP> patriarch was victorious; but in the furious contest he deposed in his turn the successor of St.
 Peter, and involved the <NORP>Latin</NORP> church in the reproach of heresy and schism.
 <PERSON>Photius</PERSON> sacrificed the peace of the world to a short and precarious reign: he fell with his patron, the <PERSON>Caesar</PERSON> Bardas; and <PERSON>Basil</PERSON> the <NORP>Macedonian</NORP> performed an act of justice in the restoration of Ignatius, whose age and dignity had not been sufficiently respected.
 From his monastery, or prison, <PERSON>Photius</PERSON> solicited the favour of the emperor by pathetic complaints and artful flattery; and the eyes of his rival were scarcely closed, when he was again restored to the throne of Constantinople.
 After the death of <PERSON>Basil</PERSON> he experienced the vicissitudes of courts and the ingratitude of a royal pupil: the patriarch was again deposed, and in his last solitary hours he might regret the freedom of a secular and studious life.
 In each revolution, the breath, the nod, of the sovereign had been accepted by a submissive clergy; and a synod of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> bishops was always prepared to hail the triumph, or to stigmatize the fall, of the holy, or the execrable, Photius.
 (9) By a delusive promise of succour or reward, the popes were tempted to countenance these various proceedings; and the synods of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> were ratified by their epistles or legates.
 But the court and the people, <PERSON>Ignatius</PERSON> and Photius, were equally adverse to their claims; their ministers were insulted or imprisoned; the procession of the Holy Ghost was forgotten; <GPE>Bulgaria</GPE> was forever annexed to the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> throne; and the schism was prolonged by their rigid censure of all the multiplied ordinations of an irregular patriarch.
 The darkness and corruption of the tenth century suspended the intercourse, without reconciling the minds, of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> nations.
 But when the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> sword restored the churches of <GPE>Apulia</GPE> to the jurisdiction of Rome, the departing flock was warned, by a petulant epistle of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> patriarch, to avoid and abhor the errors of the Latins.
 The popes excommunicate the patriarch of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> and the Greeks, A.
D.
 1054, July 16.
 The rising majesty of <GPE>Rome</GPE> could no longer brook the insolence of a rebel; and Michael Cerularius was excommunicated in the heart of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> by the pope's legates.
 Shaking the dust from their feet, they deposited on the altar of St.
 Sophia a direful anathema, (10) which enumerates the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> mortal heresies of the Greeks, and devotes the guilty teachers, and their unhappy sectaries, to the eternal society of the devil and his angels.
 According to the emergencies of the church and state, a friendly correspondence was some times resumed; the language of charity and concord was sometimes affected; but the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> have never recanted their errors; the popes have never repealed their sentence; and from this thunderbolt we may date the consummation of the schism.
 It was enlarged by each ambitious step of the <PERSON>Roman</PERSON> pontiffs: the emperors blushed and trembled at the ignominious fate of their royal brethren of Germany; and the people were scandalized by the temporal power and military life of the <NORP>Latin</NORP> clergy.
 (11) Enmity of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and Latins, A.
D.
 1100-1200.
 The aversion of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and <NORP>Latins</NORP> was nourished and manifested in the <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> expeditions to the Holy Land.
 <PERSON>Alexius</PERSON> Comnenus contrived the absence at least of the formidable pilgrims: his successors, <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> and <PERSON>Isaac</PERSON> Angelus, conspired with the <NORP>Moslems</NORP> for the ruin of the greatest princes of the Franks; and their crooked and malignant policy was seconded by the active and voluntary obedience of every order of their subjects.
 Of this hostile temper, a large portion may doubtless be ascribed to the difference of language, dress, and manners, which severs and alienates the nations of the globe.
 The pride, as well as the prudence, of the sovereign was deeply wounded by the intrusion of foreign armies, that claimed a right of traversing his dominions, and passing under the walls of his capital: his subjects were insulted and plundered by the rude strangers of the West: and the hatred of the pusillanimous <NORP>Greeks</NORP> was sharpened by secret envy of the bold and pious enterprises of the Franks.
 But these profane causes of national enmity were fortified and inflamed by the venom of religious zeal.
 Instead of a kind embrace, a hospitable reception from their <NORP>Christian</NORP> brethren of the East, every tongue was taught to repeat the names of schismatic and heretic, more odious to an orthodox ear than those of pagan and infidel: instead of being loved for the general conformity of faith and worship, they were abhorred for some rules of discipline, some questions of theology, in which themselves or their teachers might differ from the <NORP>Oriental</NORP> church.
 In the crusade of <PERSON>Louis</PERSON> the Seventh, the <NORP>Greek</NORP> clergy washed and purified the altars which had been defiled by the sacrifice of a <NORP>French</NORP> priest.
 The companions of <PERSON>Frederic</PERSON> Barbarossa deplore the injuries which they endured, both in word and deed, from the peculiar rancour of the bishops and monks.
 Their prayers and sermons excited the people against the impious Barbarians; and the patriarch is accused of declaring, that the faithful might obtain the redemption of all their sins by the extirpation of the schismatics.
 (12) An enthusiast, named Dorotheus, alarmed the fears, and restored the confidence, of the emperor, by a prophetic assurance, that the <NORP>German</NORP> heretic, after assaulting the gate of Blachernes, would be made a signal example of the divine vengeance.
 The passage of these mighty armies were rare and perilous events; but the crusades introduced a frequent and familiar intercourse between the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> nations, which enlarged their knowledge without abating their prejudices.
 The <NORP>Latins</NORP> at Constantinople.
 The wealth and luxury of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> demanded the productions of every climate: these imports were balanced by the art and labour of her numerous inhabitants; her situation invites the commerce of the world; and, in every period of her existence, that commerce has been in the hands of foreigners.
 After the decline of Amalphi, the Venetians, Pisans, and Genoese, introduced their factories and settlements into the capital of the empire: their services were rewarded with honours and immunities; they acquired the possession of lands and houses; their families were multiplied by marriages with the natives; and, after the toleration of a <NORP>Mahometan</NORP> mosque, it was impossible to interdict the churches of the <PERSON>Roman</PERSON> rite.
 (13) The <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> wives of <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> Comnenus (14) were of the race of the Franks: the first, a sister-in-law of the emperor Conrad; the second, a daughter of the prince of Antioch: he obtained for his son <PERSON>Alexius</PERSON> a daughter of <PERSON>Philip</PERSON> Augustus, king of France; and he bestowed his own daughter on a marquis of Montferrat, who was educated and dignified in the palace of Constantinople.
 The <NORP>Greek</NORP> encountered the arms, and aspired to the empire, of the West: he esteemed the valour, and trusted the fidelity, of the Franks; (15) their military talents were unfitly recompensed by the lucrative offices of judges and treasures; the policy of <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> had solicited the alliance of the pope; and the popular voice accused him of a partial bias to the nation and religion of the Latins.
 (16) During his reign, and that of his successor Alexius, they were exposed at <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> to the reproach of foreigners, heretics, and favourites; and this triple guilt was severely expiated in the tumult, which announced the return and elevation of Andronicus.
 (17)their massacre, A.
D.
 1183.
 The people rose in arms: from the <NORP>Asiatic</NORP> shore the tyrant despatched his troops and galleys to assist the national revenge; and the hopeless resistance of the strangers served only to justify the rage, and sharpen the daggers, of the assassins.
 Neither age, nor sex, nor the ties of friendship or kindred, could save the victims of national hatred, and avarice, and religious zeal; the <NORP>Latins</NORP> were slaughtered in their houses and in the streets; their quarter was reduced to ashes; the clergy were burnt in their churches, and the sick in their hospitals; and some estimate may be formed of the slain from the clemency which sold above <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> thousand <NORP>Christians</NORP> in perpetual slavery to the Turks.
 The priests and monks were the loudest and most active in the destruction of the schismatics; and they chanted a thanksgiving to the Lord, when the head of a <PERSON>Roman</PERSON> cardinal, the pope's legate, was severed from his body, fastened to the tail of a dog, and dragged, with savage mockery, through the city.
 The more diligent of the strangers had retreated, on the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> alarm, to their vessels, and escaped through the <GPE>Hellespont</GPE> from the scene of blood.
 In their flight, they burnt and ravaged <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> miles of the sea-coast; inflicted a severe revenge on the guiltless subjects of the empire; marked the priests and monks as their peculiar enemies; and compensated, by the accumulation of plunder, the loss of their property and friends.
 On their return, they exposed to <GPE>Italy</GPE> and <LOC>Europe</LOC> the wealth and weakness, the perfidy and malice, of the Greeks, whose vices were painted as the genuine characters of heresy and schism.
 The scruples of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> crusaders had neglected the fairest opportunities of securing, by the possession of Constantinople, the way to the Holy Land: domestic revolution invited, and almost compelled, the <NORP>French</NORP> and <NORP>Venetians</NORP> to achieve the conquest of the <PERSON>Roman</PERSON> empire of the East.
 The reign and character of Angelus, A.
D.
 1185-1195, Sept.
 12.
 In the series of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> princes, I have exhibited the hypocrisy and ambition, the tyranny and fall, of Andronicus, the last male of the <NORP>Comnenian</NORP> family who reigned at Constantinople.
 The revolution, which cast him headlong from the throne, saved and exalted <PERSON>Isaac</PERSON> Angelus, (18) who descended by the females from the same <NORP>Imperial</NORP> dynasty.
 The successor of a <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> <PERSON>Nero</PERSON> might have found it an easy task to deserve the esteem and affection of his subjects; they sometimes had reason to regret the administration of Andronicus.
 The sound and vigorous mind of the tyrant was capable of discerning the connection between his own and the public interest; and while he was feared by all who could inspire him with fear, the unsuspected people, and the remote provinces, might bless the inexorable justice of their master.
 But his successor was vain and jealous of the supreme power, which he wanted courage and abilities to exercise: his vices were pernicious, his virtues (if he possessed any virtues) were useless, to mankind; and the Greeks, who imputed their calamities to his negligence, denied him the merit of any transient or accidental benefits of the times.
 <PERSON>Isaac</PERSON> slept on the throne, and was awakened only by the sound of pleasure: his vacant hours were amused by comedians and buffoons, and even to these buffoons the emperor was an object of contempt: his feasts and buildings exceeded the examples of royal luxury: the number of his eunuchs and domestics amounted to <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> thousand; and a daily sum of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> thousand pounds of silver would swell to <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> millions sterling the annual expense of his household and table.
 His poverty was relieved by oppression; and the public discontent was inflamed by equal abuses in the collection, and the application, of the revenue.
 While the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> numbered the days of their servitude, a flattering prophet, whom he rewarded with the dignity of patriarch, assured him of a long and victorious reign of thirty-two years; during which he should extend his sway to Mount Libanus, and his conquests beyond the Euphrates.
 But his only step towards the accomplishment of the prediction was a splendid and scandalous embassy to Saladin, (19) to demand the restitution of the holy sepulchre, and to propose an offensive and defensive league with the enemy of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> name.
 In these unworthy hands, of <PERSON>Isaac</PERSON> and his brother, the remains of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> empire crumbled into dust.
 The Island of Cyprus, whose name excites the ideas of elegance and pleasure, was usurped by his namesake, a <NORP>Comnenian</NORP> prince; and by a strange concatenation of events, the sword of our <NORP>English</NORP> <PERSON>Richard</PERSON> bestowed that kingdom on the house of Lusignan, a rich compensation for the loss of Jerusalem.
 Revolt of the Bulgarians, A.
D.
 1186.
 The honour of the monarchy and the safety of the capital were deeply wounded by the revolt of the <NORP>Bulgarians</NORP> and Walachians.
 Since the victory of the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> Basil, they had supported, above a <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and <CARDINAL>seventy</CARDINAL> years, the loose dominion of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> princes; but no effectual measures had been adopted to impose the yoke of laws and manners on these savage tribes.
 By the command of Isaac, their sole means of subsistence, their flocks and herds, were driven away, to contribute towards the pomp of the royal nuptials; and their fierce warriors were exasperated by the denial of equal rank and pay in the military service.
 <PERSON>Peter</PERSON> and Asan, <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> powerful chiefs, of the race of the ancient kings, (20) asserted their own rights and the national freedom; their daemoniac impostors proclaimed to the crowd, that their glorious patron St.
 Demetrius had forever deserted the cause of the Greeks; and the conflagration spread from the banks of the <LOC>Danube</LOC> to the hills of <GPE>Macedonia</GPE> and Thrace.
 After some faint efforts, <PERSON>Isaac</PERSON> <PERSON>Angelus</PERSON> and his brother acquiesced in their independence; and the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> troops were soon discouraged by the bones of their fellow-soldiers, that were scattered along the passes of Mount Haemus.
 By the arms and policy of <PERSON>John</PERSON> or Joannices, the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> kingdom of <GPE>Bulgaria</GPE> was firmly established.
 The subtle <NORP>Barbarian</NORP> sent an embassy to Innocent the Third, to acknowledge himself a genuine son of <GPE>Rome</GPE> in descent and religion, (21) and humbly received from the pope the license of coining money, the royal title, and a <NORP>Latin</NORP> archbishop or patriarch.
 The <FAC>Vatican</FAC> exulted in the spiritual conquest of Bulgaria, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> object of the schism; and if the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> could have preserved the prerogatives of the church, they would gladly have resigned the rights of the monarchy.
 Usurpation and character of <PERSON>Alexius</PERSON> Angelus, A.
D.
 1195-1203, April 8.
 The <NORP>Bulgarians</NORP> were malicious enough to pray for the long life of <PERSON>Isaac</PERSON> Angelus, the surest pledge of their freedom and prosperity.
 Yet their chiefs could involve in the same indiscriminate contempt the family and nation of the emperor.
 Several of these candidates for the purple successively rose and fell under the empire of Isaac; a general, who had repelled the fleets of Sicily, was driven to revolt and ruin by the ingratitude of the prince; and his luxurious repose was disturbed by secret conspiracies and popular insurrections.
 The emperor was saved by accident, or the merit of his servants: he was at length oppressed by an ambitious brother, who, for the hope of a precarious diadem, forgot the obligations of nature, of loyalty, and of friendship.
 (23) While <PERSON>Isaac</PERSON> in the <NORP>Thracian</NORP> valleys pursued the idle and solitary pleasures of the chase, his brother, <PERSON>Alexius</PERSON> Angelus, was invested with the purple, by the unanimous suffrage of the camp; the capital and the clergy subscribed to their choice; and the vanity of the new sovereign rejected the name of his fathers for the lofty and royal appellation of the <NORP>Comnenian</NORP> race.
 On the despicable character of <PERSON>Isaac</PERSON> I have exhausted the language of contempt, and can only add, that, in a reign of <CARDINAL>eight</CARDINAL> years, the baser <PERSON>Alexius</PERSON> (24) was supported by the masculine vices of his wife Euphrosyne.
 The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> intelligence of his fall was conveyed to the late emperor by the hostile aspect and pursuit of the guards, no longer his own: he fled before them above <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> miles, as far as Stagyra, in Macedonia; but the fugitive, without an object or a follower, was arrested, brought back to Constantinople, deprived of his eyes, and confined in a lonesome tower, on a scanty allowance of bread and water.
 At the moment of the revolution, his son Alexius, whom he educated in the hope of empire, was <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> <DATE>years</DATE> of age.
 He was spared by the usurper, and reduced to attend his triumph both in peace and war; but as the army was encamped on the sea-shore, an <NORP>Italian</NORP> vessel facilitated the escape of the royal youth; and, in the disguise of a common sailor, he eluded the search of his enemies, passed the Hellespont, and found a secure refuge in the Isle of Sicily.
 After saluting the threshold of the apostles, and imploring the protection of Pope Innocent the Third, <PERSON>Alexius</PERSON> accepted the kind invitation of his sister Irene, the wife of <PERSON>Philip</PERSON> of Swabia, king of the Romans.
 But in his passage through Italy, he heard that the flower of <NORP>Western</NORP> chivalry was assembled at <GPE>Venice</GPE> for the deliverance of the Holy Land; and a ray of hope was kindled in his bosom, that their invincible swords might be employed in his father's restoration.
 The <ORDINAL>fourth</ORDINAL> crusade, A.
D.
 1198.
 About <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> or <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> <DATE>years</DATE> after the loss of Jerusalem, the nobles of <GPE>France</GPE> were again summoned to the holy war by the voice of a <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> prophet, less extravagant, perhaps, than <PERSON>Peter</PERSON> the hermit, but far below St.
 Bernard in the merit of an orator and a statesman.
 An illiterate priest of the neighbourhood of Paris, <PERSON>Fulk</PERSON> of Neuilly, (25) forsook his parochial duty, to assume the more flattering character of a popular and itinerant missionary.
 The fame of his sanctity and miracles was spread over the land; he declaimed, with severity and vehemence, against the vices of the age; and his sermons, which he preached in the streets of Paris, converted the robbers, the usurers, the prostitutes, and even the doctors and scholars of the university.
 No sooner did Innocent the <ORDINAL>Third</ORDINAL> ascend the chair of St.
 Peter, than he proclaimed in Italy, Germany, and France, the obligation of a new crusade.
 (26) The eloquent pontiff described the ruin of Jerusalem, the triumph of the Pagans, and the shame of Christendom; his liberality proposed the redemption of sins, a plenary indulgence to all who should serve in Palestine, either a year in person, or <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <DATE>years</DATE> by a substitute; (27) and among his legates and orators who blew the sacred trumpet, <PERSON>Fulk</PERSON> of <GPE>Neuilly</GPE> was the loudest and most successful.
 The situation of the principal monarchs was averse to the pious summons.
 The emperor <PERSON>Frederic</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>Second</ORDINAL> was a child; and his kingdom of <GPE>Germany</GPE> was disputed by the rival houses of <GPE>Brunswick</GPE> and Swabia, the memorable factions of the <ORG>Guelphs</ORG> and Ghibelines.
 <PERSON>Philip</PERSON> <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> of <GPE>France</GPE> had performed, and could not be persuaded to renew, the perilous vow; but as he was not less ambitious of praise than of power, he cheerfully instituted a perpetual fund for the defence of the Holy Land.
 <PERSON>Richard</PERSON> of <GPE>England</GPE> was satiated with the glory and misfortunes of his <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> adventure; and he presumed to deride the exhortations of <PERSON>Fulk</PERSON> of Neuilly, who was not abashed in the presence of kings.
 But the preacher was heard and obeyed by the great vassals, the princes of the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> order; and Theobald, or Thibaut, count of Champagne, was the foremost in the holy race.
 The valiant youth, at the age of twenty-two years, was encouraged by the domestic examples of his father, who marched in the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> crusade, and of his elder brother, who had ended his days in <GPE>Palestine</GPE> with the title of King of Jerusalem; Embraced by the barons of France.
 <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> thousand <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> knights owed service and homage to his peerage; (28) the nobles of <PERSON>Champagne</PERSON> excelled in all the exercises of war; (29) and, by his marriage with the heiress of Navarre, <PERSON>Thibaut</PERSON> could draw a band of hardy <NORP>Gascons</NORP> from either side of the Pyrenaean mountains.
 His companion in arms was Louis, count of <PERSON>Blois</PERSON> and Chartres; like himself of regal lineage, for both the princes were nephews, at the same time, of the kings of <GPE>France</GPE> and England.
 In a crowd of prelates and barons, who imitated their zeal, I distinguish the birth and merit of <PERSON>Matthew</PERSON> of Montmorency; the famous <PERSON>Simon</PERSON> of Montfort, the scourge of the Albigeois; and a valiant noble, <PERSON>Jeffrey</PERSON> of Villehardouin, (30) marshal of Champagne, (31) who has condescended, in the rude idiom of his age and country, (32) to write or dictate (33) an original narrative of the councils and actions in which he bore a memorable part.
 At the same time, Baldwin, count of Flanders, who had married the sister of Thibaut, assumed the cross at Bruges, with his brother Henry, and the principal knights and citizens of that rich and industrious province.
 (34) The vow which the chiefs had pronounced in churches, they ratified in tournaments; the operations of the war were debated in full and frequent assemblies; and it was resolved to seek the deliverance of <GPE>Palestine</GPE> in Egypt, a country, since Saladin's death, which was almost ruined by famine and civil war.
 But the fate of so many royal armies displayed the toils and perils of a land expedition; and if the <NORP>Flemings</NORP> dwelt along the ocean, the <NORP>French</NORP> barons were destitute of ships and ignorant of navigation.
 They embraced the wise resolution of choosing <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> deputies or representatives, of whom <PERSON>Villehardouin</PERSON> was one, with a discretionary trust to direct the motions, and to pledge the faith, of the whole confederacy.
 The maritime states of <GPE>Italy</GPE> were alone possessed of the means of transporting the holy warriors with their arms and horses; and the <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> deputies proceeded to Venice, to solicit, on motives of piety or interest, the aid of that powerful republic.
 State of the Venetians, A.
D.
 697-1200.
 In the invasion of <GPE>Italy</GPE> by Attila, I have mentioned (35) the flight of the <NORP>Venetians</NORP> from the fallen cities of the continent, and their obscure shelter in the chain of islands that line the extremity of the <LOC>Adriatic</LOC> Gulf.
 In the midst of the waters, free, indigent, laborious, and inaccessible, they gradually coalesced into a republic: the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> foundations of <GPE>Venice</GPE> were laid in the Island of Rialto; and the annual election of the <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> tribunes was superseded by the permanent office of a duke or doge.
 On the verge of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> empires, the <NORP>Venetians</NORP> exult in the belief of primitive and perpetual independence.
 (36) Against the Latins, their antique freedom has been asserted by the sword, and may be justified by the pen.
 <PERSON>Charlemagne</PERSON> himself resigned all claims of sovereignty to the islands of the <LOC>Adriatic</LOC> Gulf: his son <PERSON>Pepin</PERSON> was repulsed in the attacks of the lagunas or canals, too deep for the cavalry, and too shallow for the vessels; and in every age, under the <NORP>German</NORP> Caesars, the lands of the republic have been clearly distinguished from the kingdom of Italy.
 But the inhabitants of <GPE>Venice</GPE> were considered by themselves, by strangers, and by their sovereigns, as an inalienable portion of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> empire: (37) in the ninth and tenth centuries, the proofs of their subjection are numerous and unquestionable; and the vain titles, the servile honours, of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> court, so ambitiously solicited by their dukes, would have degraded the magistrates of a free people.
 But the bands of this dependence, which was never absolute or rigid, were imperceptibly relaxed by the ambition of <GPE>Venice</GPE> and the weakness of Constantinople.
 Obedience was softened into respect, privilege ripened into prerogative, and the freedom of domestic government was fortified by the independence of foreign dominion.
 The maritime cities of <LOC>Istria</LOC> and <GPE>Dalmatia</GPE> bowed to the sovereigns of the Adriatic; and when they armed against the <NORP>Normans</NORP> in the cause of Alexius, the emperor applied, not to the duty of his subjects, but to the gratitude and generosity of his faithful allies.
 The sea was their patrimony: (38) the western parts of the Mediterranean, from <GPE>Tuscany</GPE> to Gibraltar, were indeed abandoned to their rivals of <GPE>Pisa</GPE> and Genoa; but the <NORP>Venetians</NORP> acquired an early and lucrative share of the commerce of <GPE>Greece</GPE> and Egypt.
 Their riches increased with the increasing demand of Europe; their manufactures of silk and glass, perhaps the institution of their bank, are of high antiquity; and they enjoyed the fruits of their industry in the magnificence of public and private life.
 To assert her flag, to avenge her injuries, to protect the freedom of navigation, the republic could launch and man a fleet of a <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> galleys; and the Greeks, the Saracens, and the Normans, were encountered by her naval arms.
 The <NORP>Franks</NORP> of <GPE>Syria</GPE> were assisted by the <NORP>Venetians</NORP> in the reduction of the sea coast; but their zeal was neither blind nor disinterested; and in the conquest of Tyre, they shared the sovereignty of a city, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> seat of the commerce of the world.
 The policy of <GPE>Venice</GPE> was marked by the avarice of a trading, and the insolence of a maritime, power; yet her ambition was prudent: nor did she often forget that if armed galleys were the effect and safeguard, merchant vessels were the cause and supply, of her greatness.
 In her religion, she avoided the schisms of the Greeks, without yielding a servile obedience to the <PERSON>Roman</PERSON> pontiff; and a free intercourse with the infidels of every clime appears to have allayed betimes the fever of superstition.
 Her primitive government was a loose mixture of democracy and monarchy; the doge was elected by the votes of the general assembly; as long as he was popular and successful, he reigned with the pomp and authority of a prince; but in the frequent revolutions of the state, he was deposed, or banished, or slain, by the justice or injustice of the multitude.
 The twelfth century produced the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> rudiments of the wise and jealous aristocracy, which has reduced the doge to a pageant, and the people to a cipher.
 (39) Alliance of the <NORP>French</NORP> and Venetians, A.
D.
 1201.
 When the <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> ambassadors of the <NORP>French</NORP> pilgrims arrived at Venice, they were hospitably entertained in the palace of St.
 Mark, by the reigning duke; his name was <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> Dandolo; (40) and he shone in the last period of human life as <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the most illustrious characters of the times.
 Under the weight of years, and after the loss of his eyes, (41) <PERSON>Dandolo</PERSON> retained a sound understanding and a manly courage: the spirit of a hero, ambitious to signalize his reign by some memorable exploits; and the wisdom of a patriot, anxious to build his fame on the glory and advantage of his country.
 He praised the bold enthusiasm and liberal confidence of the barons and their deputies: in such a cause, and with such associates, he should aspire, were he a private man, to terminate his life; but he was the servant of the republic, and some delay was requisite to consult, on this arduous business, the judgment of his colleagues.
 The proposal of the <NORP>French</NORP> was <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> debated by the <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> sages who had been recently appointed to control the administration of the doge: it was next disclosed to the <CARDINAL>forty</CARDINAL> members of the council of state; and finally communicated to the legislative assembly of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> representatives, who were annually chosen in the <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> quarters of the city.
 In peace and war, the doge was still the chief of the republic; his legal authority was supported by the personal reputation of Dandolo: his arguments of public interest were balanced and approved; and he was authorized to inform the ambassadors of the following conditions of the treaty.
 (42) It was proposed that the crusaders should assemble at Venice, on the feast of St.
 <PERSON>John</PERSON> of the ensuing year; that flat-bottomed vessels should be prepared for <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> thousand five <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> horses, and nine thousand squires, with a number of ships sufficient for the embarkation of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> thousand five <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> knights, and <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> thousand foot; that during a term of nine months they should be supplied with provisions, and transported to whatsoever coast the service of God and <GPE>Christendom</GPE> should require; and that the republic should join the armament with a squadron of <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> galleys.
 It was required, that the pilgrims should pay, before their departure, a sum of eighty-five thousand marks of silver; and that all conquests, by sea and land, should be equally divided between the confederates.
 The terms were hard; but the emergency was pressing, and the <NORP>French</NORP> barons were not less profuse of money than of blood.
 A general assembly was convened to ratify the treaty: the stately chapel and place of St.
 Mark were filled with <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> thousand citizens; and the noble deputies were taught a new lesson of humbling themselves before the majesty of the people.
 The eloquence of their words and tears, (43) their martial aspect, and suppliant attitude, were applauded by a universal shout; as it were, says Jeffrey, by the sound of an earthquake.
 The venerable doge ascended the pulpit to urge their request by those motives of honour and virtue, which alone can be offered to a popular assembly: the treaty was transcribed on parchment, attested with oaths and seals, mutually accepted by the weeping and joyful representatives of <GPE>France</GPE> and Venice; and despatched to <GPE>Rome</GPE> for the approbation of Pope Innocent the Third.
 <CARDINAL>Two</CARDINAL> thousand marks were borrowed of the merchants for the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> expenses of the armament.
 Of the <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> deputies, <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> repassed the <LOC>Alps</LOC> to announce their success, while their <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> companions made a fruitless trial of the zeal and emulation of the republics of <GPE>Genoa</GPE> and Pisa.
 <ORG>Assembly</ORG> and departure of the crusade from Venice, A.
D.
 1202, October 8.
 The execution of the treaty was still opposed by unforeseen difficulties and delays.
 The marshal, on his return to Troyes, was embraced and approved by <PERSON>Thibaut</PERSON> count of Champagne, who had been unanimously chosen general of the confederates.
 But the health of that valiant youth already declined, and soon became hopeless; and he deplored the untimely fate, which condemned him to expire, not in a field of battle, but on a bed of sickness.
 To his brave and numerous vassals, the dying prince distributed his treasures: they swore in his presence to accomplish his vow and their own; but some there were, says the marshal, who accepted his gifts and forfeited their words.
 The more resolute champions of the cross held a parliament at <GPE>Soissons</GPE> for the election of a new general; but such was the incapacity, or jealousy, or reluctance, of the princes of France, that none could be found both able and willing to assume the conduct of the enterprise.
 They acquiesced in the choice of a stranger, of <PERSON>Boniface</PERSON> marquis of Montferrat, descended of a race of heroes, and himself of conspicuous fame in the wars and negotiations of the times; (44) nor could the piety or ambition of the <NORP>Italian</NORP> chief decline this honourable invitation.
 After visiting the <NORP>French</NORP> court, where he was received as a friend and kinsman, the marquis, in the church of Soissons, was invested with the cross of a pilgrim and the staff of a general; and immediately repassed the Alps, to prepare for the distant expedition of the East.
 About the festival of the <EVENT>Pentecost</EVENT> he displayed his banner, and marched towards <GPE>Venice</GPE> at the head of the Italians: he was preceded or followed by the counts of <GPE>Flanders</GPE> and Blois, and the most respectable barons of France; and their numbers were swelled by the pilgrims of Germany, (45) whose object and motives were similar to their own.
 The <NORP>Venetians</NORP> had fulfilled, and even surpassed, their engagements: stables were constructed for the horses, and barracks for the troops: the magazines were abundantly replenished with forage and provisions; and the fleet of transports, ships, and galleys, was ready to hoist sail as soon as the republic had received the price of the freight and armament.
 But that price far exceeded the wealth of the crusaders who were assembled at Venice.
 The Flemings, whose obedience to their count was voluntary and precarious, had embarked in their vessels for the long navigation of the ocean and Mediterranean; and many of the <NORP>French</NORP> and <NORP>Italians</NORP> had preferred a cheaper and more convenient passage from <GPE>Marseilles</GPE> and <GPE>Apulia</GPE> to the Holy Land.
 Each pilgrim might complain, that after he had furnished his own contribution, he was made responsible for the deficiency of his absent brethren: the gold and silver plate of the chiefs, which they freely delivered to the treasury of St.
 Marks, was a generous but inadequate sacrifice; and after all their efforts, thirty-four thousand marks were still wanting to complete the stipulated sum.
 The obstacle was removed by the policy and patriotism of the doge, who proposed to the barons, that if they would join their arms in reducing some revolted cities of Dalmatia, he would expose his person in the holy war, and obtain from the republic a long indulgence, till some wealthy conquest should afford the means of satisfying the debt.
 After much scruple and hesitation, they chose rather to accept the offer than to relinquish the enterprise; Siege of Zara, Nov.
 10.
 and the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> hostilities of the fleet and army were directed against Zara, (46) a strong city of the Sclavonian coast, which had renounced its allegiance to Venice, and implored the protection of the king of Hungary.
 (47) The crusaders burst the chain or boom of the harbour; landed their horses, troops, and military engines; and compelled the inhabitants, after a defence of five days, to surrender at discretion: their lives were spared, but the revolt was punished by the pillage of their houses and the demolition of their walls.
 The season was far advanced; the <NORP>French</NORP> and <NORP>Venetians</NORP> resolved to pass the <DATE>winter</DATE> in a secure harbour and plentiful country; but their repose was disturbed by national and tumultuous quarrels of the soldiers and mariners.
 The conquest of <PERSON>Zara</PERSON> had scattered the seeds of discord and scandal: the arms of the allies had been stained in their outset with the blood, not of infidels, but of Christians: the king of <GPE>Hungary</GPE> and his new subjects were themselves enlisted under the banner of the cross; and the scruples of the devout were magnified by the fear or lassitude of the reluctant pilgrims.
 The pope had excommunicated the false crusaders who had pillaged and massacred their brethren,(48) and only the marquis <PERSON>Boniface</PERSON> and <PERSON>Simon</PERSON> of <PERSON>Montfort</PERSON> escaped these spiritual thunders; the <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> by his absence from the siege, the other by his final departure from the camp.
 Innocent might absolve the simple and submissive penitents of France; but he was provoked by the stubborn reason of the Venetians, who refused to confess their guilt, to accept their pardon, or to allow, in their temporal concerns, the interposition of a priest.
 Alliance of the crusaders with the <NORP>Greek</NORP> prince, the young Alexius.
 The assembly of such formidable powers by sea and land had revived the hopes of young (49) Alexius; and both at <GPE>Venice</GPE> and Zara, he solicited the arms of the crusaders, for his own restoration and his father's (50) deliverance.
 The royal youth was recommended by <PERSON>Philip</PERSON> king of Germany: his prayers and presence excited the compassion of the camp; and his cause was embraced and pleaded by the marquis of <PERSON>Montferrat</PERSON> and the doge of Venice.
 A double alliance, and the dignity of Caesar, had connected with the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> family the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> elder brothers of Boniface: (51) he expected to derive a kingdom from the important service; and the more generous ambition of <PERSON>Dandolo</PERSON> was eager to secure the inestimable benefits of trade and dominion that might accrue to his country.
 (52) Their influence procured a favourable audience for the ambassadors of Alexius; and if the magnitude of his offers excited some suspicion, the motives and rewards which he displayed might justify the delay and diversion of those forces which had been consecrated to the deliverance of Jerusalem.
 He promised in his own and his father's name, that as soon as they should be seated on the throne of Constantinople, they would terminate the long schism of the Greeks, and submit themselves and their people to the lawful supremacy of the <PERSON>Roman</PERSON> church.
 He engaged to recompense the labours and merits of the crusaders, by the immediate payment of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> thousand marks of silver; to accompany them in person to Egypt; or, if it should be judged more advantageous, to maintain, during a year, <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> thousand men, and, during his life, five <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> knights, for the service of the Holy Land.
 These tempting conditions were accepted by the republic of Venice; and the eloquence of the doge and marquis persuaded the counts of Flanders, Blois, and St.
 Pol, with <CARDINAL>eight</CARDINAL> barons of France, to join in the glorious enterprise.
 A treaty of offensive and defensive alliance was confirmed by their oaths and seals; and each individual, according to his situation and character, was swayed by the hope of public or private advantage; by the honour of restoring an exiled monarch; or by the sincere and probable opinion, that their efforts in <GPE>Palestine</GPE> would be fruitless and unavailing, and that the acquisition of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> must precede and prepare the recovery of Jerusalem.
 But they were the chiefs or equals of a valiant band of freemen and volunteers, who thought and acted for themselves: the soldiers and clergy were divided; and, if a large majority subscribed to the alliance, the numbers and arguments of the dissidents were strong and respectable.
 (53) The boldest hearts were appalled by the report of the naval power and impregnable strength of Constantinople; and their apprehensions were disguised to the world, and perhaps to themselves, by the more decent objections of religion and duty.
 They alleged the sanctity of a vow, which had drawn them from their families and homes to the rescue of the holy sepulchre; nor should the dark and crooked counsels of human policy divert them from a pursuit, the event of which was in the hands of the Almighty.
 Their <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> offence, the attack of Zara, had been severely punished by the reproach of their conscience and the censures of the pope; nor would they again imbrue their hands in the blood of their fellow-Christians.
 The apostle of <GPE>Rome</GPE> had pronounced; nor would they usurp the right of avenging with the sword the schism of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and the doubtful usurpation of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> monarch.
 On these principles or pretences, many pilgrims, the most distinguished for their valour and piety, withdrew from the camp; and their retreat was less pernicious than the open or secret opposition of a discontented party, that labored, on every occasion, to separate the army and disappoint the enterprise.
 Voyage from <PERSON>Zara</PERSON> to Constantinople, A.
D.
 1203, April 7-June 24.
 Notwithstanding this defection, the departure of the fleet and army was vigorously pressed by the Venetians, whose zeal for the service of the royal youth concealed a just resentment to his nation and family.
 They were mortified by the recent preference which had been given to Pisa, the rival of their trade; they had a long arrear of debt and injury to liquidate with the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> court; and <PERSON>Dandolo</PERSON> might not discourage the popular tale, that he had been deprived of his eyes by the emperor Manuel, who perfidiously violated the sanctity of an ambassador.
 A similar armament, for ages, had not rode the Adriatic: it was composed of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> flat- bottomed vessels or palanders for the horses; <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and <CARDINAL>forty</CARDINAL> transports filled with men and arms; <CARDINAL>seventy</CARDINAL> store-ships laden with provisions; and <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> stout galleys, well prepared for the encounter of an enemy.
 (54) While the wind was favourable, the sky serene, and the water smooth, every eye was fixed with wonder and delight on the scene of military and naval pomp which overspread the sea.
 The shields of the knights and squires, at once an ornament and a defence, were arranged on either side of the ships; the banners of the nations and families were displayed from the stern; our modern artillery was supplied by <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> engines for casting stones and darts: the fatigues of the way were cheered with the sound of music; and the spirits of the adventurers were raised by the mutual assurance, that <CARDINAL>forty</CARDINAL> thousand <NORP>Christian</NORP> heroes were equal to the conquest of the world.
 (55) In the navigation (56) from <GPE>Venice</GPE> and Zara, the fleet was successfully steered by the skill and experience of the <NORP>Venetian</NORP> pilots: at Durazzo, the confederates <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> landed on the territories of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> empire: the Isle of Corfu afforded a station and repose; they doubled, without accident, the perilous cape of Malea, the southern point of <LOC>Peloponnesus</LOC> or the Morea; made a descent in the islands of <LOC>Negropont</LOC> and Andros; and cast anchor at <LOC>Abydus</LOC> on the <NORP>Asiatic</NORP> side of the Hellespont.
 These preludes of conquest were easy and bloodless: the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> of the provinces, without patriotism or courage, were crushed by an irresistible force: the presence of the lawful heir might justify their obedience; and it was rewarded by the modesty and discipline of the Latins.
 As they penetrated through the Hellespont, the magnitude of their navy was compressed in a narrow channel, and the face of the waters was darkened with innumerable sails.
 They again expanded in the basin of the Propontis, and traversed that placid sea, till they approached the <NORP>European</NORP> shore, at the abbey of St.
 Stephen, <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> leagues to the west of Constantinople.
 The prudent doge dissuaded them from dispersing themselves in a populous and hostile land; and, as their stock of provisions was reduced, it was resolved, in the season of harvest, to replenish their store-ships in the fertile islands of the Propontis.
 With this resolution, they directed their course: but a strong gale, and their own impatience, drove them to the eastward; and so near did they run to the shore and the city, that some volleys of stones and darts were exchanged between the ships and the rampart.
 As they passed along, they gazed with admiration on the capital of the East, or, as it should seem, of the earth; rising from her <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> hills, and towering over the continents of <LOC>Europe</LOC> and Asia.
 The swelling domes and lofty spires of five <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> palaces and churches were gilded by the sun and reflected in the waters: the walls were crowded with soldiers and spectators, whose numbers they beheld, of whose temper they were ignorant; and each heart was chilled by the reflection, that, since the beginning of the world, such an enterprise had never been undertaken by such a handful of warriors.
 But the momentary apprehension was dispelled by hope and valour; and every man, says the marshal of Champagne, glanced his eye on the sword or lance which he must speedily use in the glorious conflict.
 (57) The <NORP>Latins</NORP> cast anchor before Chalcedon; the mariners only were left in the vessels: the soldiers, horses, and arms, were safely landed; and, in the luxury of an <NORP>Imperial</NORP> palace, the barons tasted the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> fruits of their success.
 On the <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> day, the fleet and army moved towards Scutari, the <NORP>Asiatic</NORP> suburb of Constantinople: a detachment of five <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> <NORP>Greek</NORP> horse was surprised and defeated by fourscore <NORP>French</NORP> knights; and in a halt of nine days, the camp was plentifully supplied with forage and provisions.
 Fruitless negotiations of the emperor.
 In relating the invasion of a great empire, it may seem strange that I have not described the obstacles which should have checked the progress of the strangers.
 The Greeks, in truth, were an unwarlike people; but they were rich, industrious, and subject to the will of a single man: had that man been capable of fear, when his enemies were at a distance, or of courage, when they approached his person.
 The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> rumour of his nephew's alliance with the <NORP>French</NORP> and <NORP>Venetians</NORP> was despised by the usurper Alexius: his flatterers persuaded him, that in this contempt he was bold and sincere; and each evening, in the close of the banquet, he thrice discomfited the <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> of the West.
 These <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> had been justly terrified by the report of his naval power; and the sixteen <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> fishing boats of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> (58) could have manned a fleet, to sink them in the Adriatic, or stop their entrance in the mouth of the Hellespont.
 But all force may be annihilated by the negligence of the prince and the venality of his ministers.
 The great duke, or admiral, made a scandalous, almost a public, auction of the sails, the masts, and the rigging: the royal forests were reserved for the more important purpose of the chase; and the trees, says Nicetas, were guarded by the eunuchs, like the groves of religious worship.
 (59) From his dream of pride, <PERSON>Alexius</PERSON> was awakened by the siege of Zara, and the rapid advances of the Latins; as soon as he saw the danger was real, he thought it inevitable, and his vain presumption was lost in abject despondency and despair.
 He suffered these contemptible <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> to pitch their camp in the sight of the palace; and his apprehensions were thinly disguised by the pomp and menace of a suppliant embassy.
 The sovereign of the <NORP>Romans</NORP> was astonished (his ambassadors were instructed to say) at the hostile appearance of the strangers.
 If these pilgrims were sincere in their vow for the deliverance of Jerusalem, his voice must applaud, and his treasures should assist, their pious design but should they dare to invade the sanctuary of empire, their numbers, were they <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> times more considerable, should not protect them from his just resentment.
 The answer of the doge and barons was simple and magnanimous.
 Passage of the Bosphorus, July 6.
 On the tenth day of their encampment at Scutari, the crusaders prepared themselves, as soldiers and as Catholics, for the passage of the Bosphorus.
 Perilous indeed was the adventure; the stream was broad and rapid: in a calm the current of the <PRODUCT>Euxine</PRODUCT> might drive down the liquid and unextinguishable fires of the Greeks; and the opposite shores of <LOC>Europe</LOC> were defended by <CARDINAL>seventy</CARDINAL> thousand horse and foot in formidable array.
 On this memorable day, which happened to be bright and pleasant, the <NORP>Latins</NORP> were distributed in <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> battles or divisions; the first, or vanguard, was led by the count of Flanders, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the most powerful of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> princes in the skill and number of his crossbows.
 The <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> successive battles of the <NORP>French</NORP> were commanded by his brother Henry, the counts of St.
 Pol and Blois, and <PERSON>Matthew</PERSON> of Montmorency; the last of whom was honoured by the voluntary service of the marshal and nobles of Champagne.
 The <ORDINAL>sixth</ORDINAL> division, the rear-guard and reserve of the army, was conducted by the marquis of Montferrat, at the head of the <NORP>Germans</NORP> and Lombards.
 The chargers, saddled, with their long comparisons dragging on the ground, were embarked in the flat palanders; (60) and the knights stood by the side of their horses, in complete armour, their helmets laced, and their lances in their hands.
 The numerous train of serjeants (61) and archers occupied the transports; and each transport was towed by the strength and swiftness of a galley.
 The <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> divisions traversed the Bosphorus, without encountering an enemy or an obstacle: to land the foremost was the wish, to conquer or die was the resolution, of every division and of every soldier.
 Jealous of the preeminence of danger, the knights in their heavy armour leaped into the sea, when it rose as high as their girdle; the sergeants and archers were animated by their valour; and the squires, letting down the draw-bridges of the palanders, led the horses to the shore.
 Before their squadrons could mount, and form, and couch their Lances, the <CARDINAL>seventy</CARDINAL> thousand <NORP>Greeks</NORP> had vanished from their sight: the timid <PERSON>Alexius</PERSON> gave the example to his troops; and it was only by the plunder of his rich pavilions that the <NORP>Latins</NORP> were informed that they had fought against an emperor.
 In the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> consternation of the flying enemy, they resolved, by a double attack, to open the entrance of the harbour.
 The tower of Galata, (62) in the suburb of Pera, was attacked and stormed by the French, while the <NORP>Venetians</NORP> assumed the more difficult task of forcing the boom or chain that was stretched from that tower to the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> shore.
 After some fruitless attempts, their intrepid perseverance prevailed: <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> ships of war, the relics of the <NORP>Grecian</NORP> navy, were either sunk or taken: the enormous and massy links of iron were cut asunder by the shears, or broken by the weight, of the galleys; (63) and the <NORP>Venetian</NORP> fleet, safe and triumphant, rode at anchor in the port of Constantinople.
 By these daring achievements, a remnant of <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> thousand <NORP>Latins</NORP> solicited the license of besieging a capital which contained above <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> thousand inhabitants, (64) able, though not willing, to bear arms in defence of their country.
 Such an account would indeed suppose a population of near <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> millions; but whatever abatement may be required in the numbers of the Greeks, the belief of those numbers will equally exalt the fearless spirit of their assailants.
 <ORDINAL>First</ORDINAL> siege and conquest of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> by the Latins, July <CARDINAL>7</CARDINAL> -18.
 In the choice of the attack, the <NORP>French</NORP> and <NORP>Venetians</NORP> were divided by their habits of life and warfare.
 The former affirmed with truth, that <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> was most accessible on the side of the sea and the harbour.
 The latter might assert with honour, that they had long enough trusted their lives and fortunes to a frail bark and a precarious element, and loudly demanded a trial of knighthood, a firm ground, and a close onset, either on foot or on horseback.
 After a prudent compromise, of employing the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> nations by sea and land, in the service best suited to their character, the fleet covering the army, they both proceeded from the entrance to the extremity of the harbour: the stone bridge of the river was hastily repaired; and the <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> battles of the <NORP>French</NORP> formed their encampment against the front of the capital, the basis of the triangle which runs about <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> miles from the port to the Propontis.
 (65) On the edge of a broad ditch, at the foot of a lofty rampart, they had leisure to contemplate the difficulties of their enterprise.
 The gates to the right and left of their narrow camp poured forth frequent sallies of cavalry and light-infantry, which cut off their stragglers, swept the country of provisions, sounded the alarm five or <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> times in the course of each day, and compelled them to plant a palisade, and sink an entrenchment, for their immediate safety.
 In the supplies and convoys the <NORP>Venetians</NORP> had been too sparing, or the <NORP>Franks</NORP> too voracious: the usual complaints of hunger and scarcity were heard, and perhaps felt their stock of flour would be exhausted in <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> weeks; and their disgust of salt meat tempted them to taste the flesh of their horses.
 The trembling usurper was supported by Theodore Lascaris, his son-in-law, a valiant youth, who aspired to save and to rule his country; the Greeks, regardless of that country, were awakened to the defence of their religion; but their firmest hope was in the strength and spirit of the <NORP>Varangian</NORP> guards, of the <NORP>Danes</NORP> and English, as they are named in the writers of the times.
 (66) After <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> days' incessant labour, the ground was levelled, the ditch filled, the approaches of the besiegers were regularly made, and <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> engines of assault exercised their various powers to clear the rampart, to batter the walls, and to sap the foundations.
 On the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> appearance of a breach, the scaling-ladders were applied: the numbers that defended the vantage ground repulsed and oppressed the adventurous Latins; but they admired the resolution of <CARDINAL>fifteen</CARDINAL> knights and sergeants, who had gained the ascent, and maintained their perilous station till they were precipitated or made prisoners by the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> guards.
 On the side of the harbour the naval attack was more successfully conducted by the Venetians; and that industrious people employed every resource that was known and practiced before the invention of gunpowder.
 A double line, <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> bow-shots in front, was formed by the galleys and ships; and the swift motion of the former was supported by the weight and loftiness of the latter, whose decks, and poops, and turret, were the platforms of military engines, that discharged their shot over the heads of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> line.
 The soldiers, who leaped from the galleys on shore, immediately planted and ascended their scaling-ladders, while the large ships, advancing more slowly into the intervals, and lowering a draw-bridge, opened a way through the air from their masts to the rampart.
 In the midst of the conflict, the doge, a venerable and conspicuous form, stood aloft in complete armour on the prow of his galley.
 The great standard of St.
 Mark was displayed before him; his threats, promises, and exhortations, urged the diligence of the rowers; his vessel was the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> that struck; and <PERSON>Dandolo</PERSON> was the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> warrior on the shore.
 The nations admired the magnanimity of the blind old man, without reflecting that his age and infirmities diminished the price of life, and enhanced the value of immortal glory.
 On a sudden, by an invisible hand, (for the standard-bearer was probably slain,) the banner of the republic was fixed on the rampart: <CARDINAL>twenty-five</CARDINAL> towers were rapidly occupied; and, by the cruel expedient of fire, the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> were driven from the adjacent quarter.
 The doge had despatched the intelligence of his success, when he was checked by the danger of his confederates.
 <PERSON>Nobly</PERSON> declaring that he would rather die with the pilgrims than gain a victory by their destruction, <PERSON>Dandolo</PERSON> relinquished his advantage, recalled his troops, and hastened to the scene of action.
 He found the <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> weary diminutive battles of the <NORP>French</NORP> encompassed by <CARDINAL>sixty</CARDINAL> squadrons of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> cavalry, the least of which was more numerous than the largest of their divisions.
 Shame and despair had provoked <PERSON>Alexius</PERSON> to the last effort of a general sally; but he was awed by the firm order and manly aspect of the Latins; and, after skirmishing at a distance, withdrew his troops in the close of the evening.
 The silence or tumult of the night exasperated his fears; and the timid usurper, collecting a treasure of <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> thousand pounds of gold, basely deserted his wife, his people, and his fortune; threw himself into a bark; stole through the Bosphorus; and landed in shameful safety in an obscure harbour of Thrace.
 As soon as they were apprised of his flight, the <NORP>Greek</NORP> nobles sought pardon and peace in the dungeon where the blind <PERSON>Isaac</PERSON> expected each hour the visit of the executioner.
 Again saved and exalted by the vicissitudes of fortune, the captive in his <NORP>Imperial</NORP> robes was replace on the throne, and surrounded with prostrate slaves, whose real terror and affected joy he was incapable of discerning.
 At the dawn of day, hostilities were suspended, and the <NORP>Latin</NORP> chiefs were surprised by a message from the lawful and reigning emperor, who was impatient to embrace his son, and to reward his generous deliverers.
 (67) Restoration of the emperor <PERSON>Isaac</PERSON> Angelus, and his son Alexius, July 19.
 But these generous deliverers were unwilling to release their hostage, till they had obtained from his father the payment, or at least the promise, of their recompense.
 They chose <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> ambassadors, <PERSON>Matthew</PERSON> of Montmorency, our historian the marshal of Champagne, and <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> Venetians, to congratulate the emperor.
 The gates were thrown open on their approach, the streets on both sides were lined with the battle axes of the <NORP>Danish</NORP> and <NORP>English</NORP> guard: the presence-chamber glittered with gold and jewels, the false substitute of virtue and power: by the side of the blind <PERSON>Isaac</PERSON> his wife was seated, the sister of the king of Hungary: and by her appearance, the noble matrons of <GPE>Greece</GPE> were drawn from their domestic retirement, and mingled with the circle of senators and soldiers.
 The Latins, by the mouth of the marshal, spoke like men conscious of their merits, but who respected the work of their own hands; and the emperor clearly understood, that his son's engagements with <GPE>Venice</GPE> and the pilgrims must be ratified without hesitation or delay.
 Withdrawing into a private chamber with the empress, a chamberlain, an interpreter, and the <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> ambassadors, the father of young <PERSON>Alexius</PERSON> inquired with some anxiety into the nature of his stipulations.
 The submission of the <NORP>Eastern</NORP> empire to the pope, the succour of the Holy Land, and a present contribution of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> thousand marks of silver.
 — After this satisfactory assurance, the barons mounted on horseback, and introduced the heir of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> to the city and palace: his youth and marvellous adventures engaged every heart in his favour, and <PERSON>Alexius</PERSON> was solemnly crowned with his father in the dome of St.
 Sophia.
 In the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> days of his reign, the people, already blessed with the restoration of plenty and peace, was delighted by the joyful catastrophe of the tragedy; and the discontent of the nobles, their regret, and their fears, were covered by the polished surface of pleasure and loyalty The mixture of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> discordant nations in the same capital might have been pregnant with mischief and danger; and the suburb of Galata, or Pera, was assigned for the quarters of the <NORP>French</NORP> and Venetians.
 But the liberty of trade and familiar intercourse was allowed between the friendly nations: and each day the pilgrims were tempted by devotion or curiosity to visit the churches and palaces of Constantinople.
 Their rude minds, insensible perhaps of the finer arts, were astonished by the magnificent scenery: and the poverty of their native towns enhanced the populousness and riches of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> metropolis of Christendom.
 (68) Descending from his state, young <PERSON>Alexius</PERSON> was prompted by interest and gratitude to repeat his frequent and familiar visits to his <NORP>Latin</NORP> allies; and in the freedom of the table, the gay petulance of the <NORP>French</NORP> sometimes forgot the emperor of the East.
 (69) In their most serious conferences, it was agreed, that the reunion of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> churches must be the result of patience and time; but avarice was less tractable than zeal; and a larger sum was instantly disbursed to appease the wants, and silence the importunity, of the crusaders.
 (70) <PERSON>Alexius</PERSON> was alarmed by the approaching hour of their departure: their absence might have relieved him from the engagement which he was yet incapable of performing; but his friends would have left him, naked and alone, to the caprice and prejudice of a perfidious nation.
 He wished to bribe their stay, the delay of a year, by undertaking to defray their expense, and to satisfy, in their name, the freight of the <NORP>Venetian</NORP> vessels.
 The offer was agitated in the council of the barons; and, after a repetition of their debates and scruples, a majority of votes again acquiesced in the advice of the doge and the prayer of the young emperor.
 At the price of sixteen <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> pounds of gold, he prevailed on the marquis of <PERSON>Montferrat</PERSON> to lead him with an army round the provinces of Europe; to establish his authority, and pursue his uncle, while <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> was awed by the presence of <PERSON>Baldwin</PERSON> and his confederates of <GPE>France</GPE> and Flanders.
 The expedition was successful: the blind emperor exulted in the success of his arms, and listened to the predictions of his flatterers, that the same <GPE>Providence</GPE> which had raised him from the dungeon to the throne, would heal his gout, restore his sight, and watch over the long prosperity of his reign.
 Yet the mind of the suspicious old man was tormented by the rising glories of his son; nor could his pride conceal from his envy, that, while his own name was pronounced in faint and reluctant acclamations, the royal youth was the theme of spontaneous and universal praise.
 (71) Quarrel of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and Latins.
 By the recent invasion, the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> were awakened from a dream of nine centuries; from the vain presumption that the capital of the <PERSON>Roman</PERSON> empire was impregnable to foreign arms.
 The strangers of the <LOC>West</LOC> had violated the city, and bestowed the sceptre, of Constantine: their <NORP>Imperial</NORP> clients soon became as unpopular as themselves: the well-known vices of <PERSON>Isaac</PERSON> were rendered still more contemptible by his infirmities, and the young <PERSON>Alexius</PERSON> was hated as an apostate, who had renounced the manners and religion of his country.
 His secret covenant with the <NORP>Latins</NORP> was divulged or suspected; the people, and especially the clergy, were devoutly attached to their faith and superstition; and every convent, and every shop, resounded with the danger of the church and the tyranny of the pope.
 (72) An empty treasury could ill supply the demands of regal luxury and foreign extortion: the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> refused to avert, by a general tax, the impending evils of servitude and pillage; the oppression of the rich excited a more dangerous and personal resentment; and if the emperor melted the plate, and despoiled the images, of the sanctuary, he seemed to justify the complaints of heresy and sacrilege.
 During the absence of Marquis <PERSON>Boniface</PERSON> and his <NORP>Imperial</NORP> pupil, <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> was visited with a calamity which might be justly imputed to the zeal and indiscretion of the <NORP>Flemish</NORP> pilgrims.
 (73) In <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of their visits to the city, they were scandalized by the aspect of a mosque or synagogue, in which <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> God was worshipped, without a partner or a son.
 Their effectual mode of controversy was to attack the infidels with the sword, and their habitation with fire: but the infidels, and some <NORP>Christian</NORP> neighbours, presumed to defend their lives and properties; and the flames which bigotry had kindled, consumed the most orthodox and innocent structures.
 During <CARDINAL>eight</CARDINAL> days and nights, the conflagration spread above a league in front, from the harbour to the Propontis, over the thickest and most populous regions of the city.
 It is not easy to count the stately churches and palaces that were reduced to a smoking ruin, to value the merchandise that perished in the trading streets, or to number the families that were involved in the common destruction.
 By this outrage, which the doge and the barons in vain affected to disclaim, the name of the <NORP>Latins</NORP> became still more unpopular; and the colony of that nation, above <CARDINAL>fifteen</CARDINAL> thousand persons, consulted their safety in a hasty retreat from the city to the protection of their standard in the suburb of Pera.
 The emperor returned in triumph; but the firmest and most dexterous policy would have been insufficient to steer him through the tempest, which overwhelmed the person and government of that unhappy youth.
 His own inclination, and his father's advice, attached him to his benefactors; but <PERSON>Alexius</PERSON> hesitated between gratitude and patriotism, between the fear of his subjects and of his allies.
 (74) By his feeble and fluctuating conduct he lost the esteem and confidence of both; and, while he invited the marquis of <PERSON>Monferrat</PERSON> to occupy the palace, he suffered the nobles to conspire, and the people to arm, for the deliverance of their country.
 Regardless of his painful situation, the <NORP>Latin</NORP> chiefs repeated their demands, resented his delays, suspected his intentions, and exacted a decisive answer of peace or war.
 The haughty summons was delivered by <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <NORP>French</NORP> knights and <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <NORP>Venetian</NORP> deputies, who girded their swords, mounted their horses, pierced through the angry multitude, and entered, with a fearful countenance, the palace and presence of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> emperor.
 In a peremptory tone, they recapitulated their services and his engagements; and boldly declared, that unless their just claims were fully and immediately satisfied, they should no longer hold him either as a sovereign or a friend.
 After this defiance, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> that had ever wounded an <NORP>Imperial</NORP> ear, they departed without betraying any symptoms of fear; but their escape from a servile palace and a furious city astonished the ambassadors themselves; and their return to the camp was the signal of mutual hostility.
 The war renewed, A.
D.
 1204.
 Among the Greeks, all authority and wisdom were overborne by the impetuous multitude, who mistook their rage for valour, their numbers for strength, and their fanaticism for the support and inspiration of Heaven.
 In the eyes of both nations <PERSON>Alexius</PERSON> was false and contemptible; the base and spurious race of the <PERSON>Angeli</PERSON> was rejected with clamorous disdain; and the people of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> encompassed the senate, to demand at their hands a more worthy emperor.
 To every senator, conspicuous by his birth or dignity, they successively presented the purple: by each senator the deadly garment was repulsed: the contest lasted <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> days; and we may learn from the historian Nicetas, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the members of the assembly, that fear and weaknesses were the guardians of their loyalty.
 A phantom, who vanished in oblivion, was forcibly proclaimed by the crowd: (75) but the author of the tumult, and the leader of the war, was a prince of the house of Ducas; and his common appellation of <PERSON>Alexius</PERSON> must be discriminated by the epithet of Mourzoufle, (76) which in the vulgar idiom expressed the close junction of his black and shaggy eyebrows.
 At once a patriot and a courtier, the perfidious Mourzoufle, who was not destitute of cunning and courage, opposed the <NORP>Latins</NORP> both in speech and action, inflamed the passions and prejudices of the Greeks, and insinuated himself into the favour and confidence of Alexius, who trusted him with the office of great chamberlain, and tinged his buskins with the colours of royalty.
 At the dead of night, he rushed into the bed-chamber with an affrighted aspect, exclaiming, that the palace was attacked by the people and betrayed by the guards.
 Starting from his couch, the unsuspecting prince threw himself into the arms of his enemy, who had contrived his escape by a private staircase.
 But that staircase terminated in a prison: <PERSON>Alexius</PERSON> and his father deposed by Mourzoufle, February 8.
 <PERSON>Alexius</PERSON> was seized, stripped, and loaded with chains; and, after tasting some days the bitterness of death, he was poisoned, or strangled, or beaten with clubs, at the command, or in the presence, of the tyrant.
 The emperor <PERSON>Isaac</PERSON> <PERSON>Angelus</PERSON> soon followed his son to the grave; and Mourzoufle, perhaps, might spare the superfluous crime of hastening the extinction of impotence and blindness.
 <ORDINAL>Second</ORDINAL> siege, January - April.
 The death of the emperors, and the usurpation of Mourzoufle, had changed the nature of the quarrel.
 It was no longer the disagreement of allies who overvalued their services, or neglected their obligations: the <NORP>French</NORP> and <NORP>Venetians</NORP> forgot their complaints against Alexius, dropped a tear on the untimely fate of their companion, and swore revenge against the perfidious nation who had crowned his assassin.
 Yet the prudent doge was still inclined to negotiate: he asked as a debt, a subsidy, or a fine, <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> thousand pounds of gold, about <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> millions sterling; nor would the conference have been abruptly broken, if the zeal, or policy, of <PERSON>Mourzoufle</PERSON> had not refused to sacrifice the <NORP>Greek</NORP> church to the safety of the state.
 (77) Amidst the invectives of his foreign and domestic enemies, we may discern, that he was not unworthy of the character which he had assumed, of the public champion: the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> siege of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> was far more laborious than the first; the treasury was replenished, and discipline was restored, by a severe inquisition into the abuses of the former reign; and Mourzoufle, an iron mace in his hand, visiting the posts, and affecting the port and aspect of a warrior, was an object of terror to his soldiers, at least, and to his kinsmen.
 Before and after the death of Alexius, the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> made <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> vigorous and well-conducted attempts to burn the navy in the harbour; but the skill and courage of the <NORP>Venetians</NORP> repulsed the fire-ships; and the vagrant flames wasted themselves without injury in the sea.
 (78) In a nocturnal sally the <NORP>Greek</NORP> emperor was vanquished by Henry, brother of the count of Flanders: the advantages of number and surprise aggravated the shame of his defeat: his buckler was found on the field of battle; and the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> standard, (79) a divine image of the Virgin, was presented, as a trophy and a relic to the <NORP>Cistercian</NORP> monks, the disciples of St.
 Bernard.
 Near <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> months, without excepting the holy season of Lent, were consumed in skirmishes and preparations, before the <NORP>Latins</NORP> were ready or resolved for a general assault.
 The land fortifications had been found impregnable; and the <NORP>Venetian</NORP> pilots represented, that, on the shore of the Propontis, the anchorage was unsafe, and the ships must be driven by the current far away to the straits of the Hellespont; a prospect not unpleasing to the reluctant pilgrims, who sought every opportunity of breaking the army.
 From the harbour, therefore, the assault was determined by the assailants, and expected by the besieged; and the emperor had placed his scarlet pavilions on a neighbouring height, to direct and animate the efforts of his troops.
 A fearless spectator, whose mind could entertain the ideas of pomp and pleasure, might have admired the long array of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> embattled armies, which extended above <CARDINAL>half</CARDINAL> a league, the <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> on the ships and galleys, the other on the walls and towers raised above the ordinary level by several stages of wooden turrets.
 Their <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> fury was spent in the discharge of darts, stones, and fire, from the engines; but the water was deep; the <NORP>French</NORP> were bold; the <NORP>Venetians</NORP> were skilful; they approached the walls; and a desperate conflict of swords, spears, and battle- axes, was fought on the trembling bridges that grappled the floating, to the stable, batteries.
 In more than a <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> places, the assault was urged, and the defence was sustained; till the superiority of ground and numbers finally prevailed, and the <NORP>Latin</NORP> trumpets sounded a retreat.
 On the ensuing days, the attack was renewed with equal vigour, and a similar event; and, in the night, the doge and the barons held a council, apprehensive only for the public danger: not a voice pronounced the words of escape or treaty; and each warrior, according to his temper, embraced the hope of victory, or the assurance of a glorious death.
 (80) By the experience of the former siege, the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> were instructed, but the <NORP>Latins</NORP> were animated; and the knowledge that <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> might be taken, was of more avail than the local precautions which that knowledge had inspired for its defence.
 In the <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> assault, <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> ships were linked together to double their strength; a strong north wind drove them on the shore; the bishops of <GPE>Troyes</GPE> and <GPE>Soissons</GPE> led the van; and the auspicious names of the pilgrim and the paradise resounded along the line.
 (81) The episcopal banners were displayed on the walls; a <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> marks of silver had been promised to the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> adventurers; and if their reward was intercepted by death, their names have been immortalized by fame.
 <CARDINAL>Four</CARDINAL> towers were scaled; <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> gates were burst open; and the <NORP>French</NORP> knights, who might tremble on the waves, felt themselves invincible on horseback on the solid ground.
 Shall I relate that the <CARDINAL>thousands</CARDINAL> who guarded the emperor's person fled on the approach, and before the lance, of a single warrior? Their ignominious flight is attested by their countryman Nicetas: an army of phantoms marched with the <NORP>French</NORP> hero, and he was magnified to a giant in the eyes of the Greeks.
 (82) While the fugitives deserted their posts and cast away their arms, the <NORP>Latins</NORP> entered the city under the banners of their leaders: the streets and gates opened for their passage; and either design or accident kindled a <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> conflagration, which consumed in a few hours the measure of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> of the largest cities of France.
 (83) In the close of evening, the barons checked their troops, and fortified their stations: They were awed by the extent and populousness of the capital, which might yet require the labour of a month, if the churches and palaces were conscious of their internal strength.
 But in the morning, a suppliant procession, with crosses and images, announced the submission of the Greeks, and deprecated the wrath of the conquerors: the usurper escaped through the golden gate: the palaces of <LOC>Blachernae</LOC> and <LOC>Boucoleon</LOC> were occupied by the count of <GPE>Flanders</GPE> and the marquis of Montferrat; and the empire, which still bore the name of Constantine, and the title of Roman, was subverted by the arms of the <NORP>Latin</NORP> pilgrims.
 (84) Pillage of Constantinople.
 <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> had been taken by storm; and no restraints, except those of religion and humanity, were imposed on the conquerors by the laws of war.
 Boniface, marquis of Montferrat, still acted as their general; and the Greeks, who revered his name as that of their future sovereign, were heard to exclaim in a lamentable tone, "Holy marquis-king, have mercy upon us!" His prudence or compassion opened the gates of the city to the fugitives; and he exhorted the soldiers of the cross to spare the lives of their fellow- Christians.
 The streams of blood that flowed down the pages of <PERSON>Nicetas</PERSON> may be reduced to the slaughter of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> thousand of his unresisting countrymen; (85) and the greater part was massacred, not by the strangers, but by the Latins, who had been driven from the city, and who exercised the revenge of a triumphant faction.
 Yet of these exiles, some were less mindful of injuries than of benefits; and <PERSON>Nicetas</PERSON> himself was indebted for his safety to the generosity of a <NORP>Venetian</NORP> merchant.
 Pope Innocent the <ORDINAL>Third</ORDINAL> accuses the pilgrims for respecting, in their lust, neither age nor sex, nor religious profession; and bitterly laments that the deeds of darkness, fornication, adultery, and incest, were perpetrated in open day; and that noble matrons and holy nuns were polluted by the grooms and peasants of the <NORP>Catholic</NORP> camp.
 (86) It is indeed probable that the license of victory prompted and covered a multitude of sins: but it is certain, that the capital of the <LOC>East</LOC> contained a stock of venal or willing beauty, sufficient to satiate the desires of <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> thousand pilgrims; and female prisoners were no longer subject to the right or abuse of domestic slavery.
 The marquis of <PERSON>Montferrat</PERSON> was the patron of discipline and decency; the count of <GPE>Flanders</GPE> was the mirror of chastity: they had forbidden, under pain of death, the rape of married women, or virgins, or nuns; and the proclamation was sometimes invoked by the vanquished (87) and respected by the victors.
 Their cruelty and lust were moderated by the authority of the chiefs, and feelings of the soldiers; for we are no longer describing an irruption of the northern savages; and however ferocious they might still appear, time, policy, and religion had civilized the manners of the French, and still more of the Italians.
 But a free scope was allowed to their avarice, which was glutted, even in the holy week, by the pillage of Constantinople.
 The right of victory, unshackled by any promise or treaty, had confiscated the public and private wealth of the Greeks; and every hand, according to its size and strength, might lawfully execute the sentence and seize the forfeiture.
 A portable and universal standard of exchange was found in the coined and uncoined metals of gold and silver, which each captor, at home or abroad, might convert into the possessions most suitable to his temper and situation.
 Of the treasures, which trade and luxury had accumulated, the silks, velvets, furs, the gems, spices, and rich movables, were the most precious, as they could not be procured for money in the ruder countries of Europe.
 Division of the spoil.
 An order of rapine was instituted; nor was the share of each individual abandoned to industry or chance.
 Under the tremendous penalties of perjury, excommunication, and death, the <NORP>Latins</NORP> were bound to deliver their plunder into the common stock: <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> churches were selected for the deposit and distribution of the spoil: a single share was allotted to a foot-soldier; <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> for a sergeant on horseback; <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> to a knight; and larger proportions according to the rank and merit of the barons and princes.
 For violating this sacred engagement, a knight belonging to the count of St.
 Paul was hanged with his shield and coat of arms round his neck; his example might render similar offenders more artful and discreet; but avarice was more powerful than fear; and it is generally believed that the secret far exceeded the acknowledged plunder.
 Yet the magnitude of the prize surpassed the largest scale of experience or expectation.
 (88) After the whole had been equally divided between the <NORP>French</NORP> and Venetians, <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> thousand marks were deducted to satisfy the debts of the former and the demands of the latter.
 The residue of the <NORP>French</NORP> amounted to <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> thousand marks of silver, (89) about <CARDINAL>eight</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> thousand pounds sterling; nor can I better appreciate the value of that sum in the public and private transactions of the age, than by defining it as <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> times the annual revenue of the kingdom of England.
 (90) Misery of the Greeks.
 In this great revolution we enjoy the singular felicity of comparing the narratives of <PERSON>Villehardouin</PERSON> and Nicetas, the opposite feelings of the marshal of <PERSON>Champagne</PERSON> and the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> senator.
 (91) At the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> view it should seem that the wealth of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> was only transferred from <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> nation to another; and that the loss and sorrow of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> is exactly balanced by the joy and advantage of the Latins.
 But in the miserable account of war, the gain is never equivalent to the loss, the pleasure to the pain; the smiles of the <NORP>Latins</NORP> were transient and fallacious; the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> forever wept over the ruins of their country; and their real calamities were aggravated by sacrilege and mockery.
 What benefits accrued to the conquerors from the <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> fires which annihilated so vast a portion of the buildings and riches of the city? What a stock of such things, as could neither be used nor transported, was maliciously or wantonly destroyed! How much treasure was idly wasted in gaming, debauchery, and riot! And what precious objects were bartered for a vile price by the impatience or ignorance of the soldiers, whose reward was stolen by the base industry of the last of the Greeks! These alone, who had nothing to lose, might derive some profit from the revolution; but the misery of the upper ranks of society is strongly painted in the personal adventures of <PERSON>Nicetas</PERSON> himself His stately palace had been reduced to ashes in the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> conflagration; and the senator, with his family and friends, found an obscure shelter in another house which he possessed near the church of St.
 Sophia.
 It was the door of this mean habitation that his friend, the <NORP>Venetian</NORP> merchant, guarded in the disguise of a soldier, till <PERSON>Nicetas</PERSON> could save, by a precipitate flight, the relics of his fortune and the chastity of his daughter.
 In a cold, wintry season, these fugitives, nursed in the lap of prosperity, departed on foot; his wife was with child; the desertion of their slaves compelled them to carry their baggage on their own shoulders; and their women, whom they placed in the centre, were exhorted to conceal their beauty with dirt, instead of adorning it with paint and jewels Every step was exposed to insult and danger: the threats of the strangers were less painful than the taunts of the plebeians, with whom they were now levelled; nor did the exiles breathe in safety till their mournful pilgrimage was concluded at Sclymbria, above <CARDINAL>forty</CARDINAL> miles from the capital.
 On the way they overtook the patriarch, without attendance and almost without apparel, riding on an ass, and reduced to a state of apostolical poverty, which, had it been voluntary, might perhaps have been meritorious.
 In the mean while, his desolate churches were profaned by the licentiousness and party zeal of the Latins.
 Sacrilege and mockery.
 After stripping the gems and pearls, they converted the chalices into drinking-cups; their tables, on which they gamed and feasted, were covered with the pictures of <PERSON>Christ</PERSON> and the saints; and they trampled under foot the most venerable objects of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> worship.
 In the cathedral of St.
 Sophia, the ample veil of the sanctuary was rent asunder for the sake of the golden fringe; and the altar, a monument of art and riches, was broken in pieces and shared among the captors.
 Their mules and horses were laden with the wrought silver and gilt carvings, which they tore down from the doors and pulpit; and if the beasts stumbled under the burden, they were stabbed by their impatient drivers, and the holy pavement streamed with their impure blood.
 A prostitute was seated on the throne of the patriarch; and that daughter of Belial, as she is styled, sung and danced in the church, to ridicule the hymns and processions of the Orientals.
 Nor were the repositories of the royal dead secure from violation: in the church of the Apostles, the tombs of the emperors were rifled; and it is said, that after <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> centuries the corpse of <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> was found without any signs of decay or putrefaction.
 In the streets, the <NORP>French</NORP> and <NORP>Flemings</NORP> clothed themselves and their horses in painted robes and flowing head-dresses of linen; and the coarse intemperance of their feasts (92) insulted the splendid sobriety of the East.
 To expose the arms of a people of scribes and scholars, they affected to display a pen, an inkhorn, and a sheet of paper, without discerning that the instruments of science and valour were alike feeble and useless in the hands of the modern Greeks.
 Destruction of the statues.
 Their reputation and their language encouraged them, however, to despise the ignorance and to overlook the progress of the Latins.
 (93) In the love of the arts, the national difference was still more obvious and real; the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> preserved with reverence the works of their ancestors, which they could not imitate; and, in the destruction of the statues of Constantinople, we are provoked to join in the complaints and invectives of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> historian.
 (94) We have seen how the rising city was adorned by the vanity and despotism of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> founder: in the ruins of paganism, some gods and heroes were saved from the axe of superstition; and the forum and hippodrome were dignified with the relics of a better age.
 Several of these are described by Nicetas, (95) in a florid and affected style; and from his descriptions I shall select some interesting particulars.
 1.
 The victorious charioteers were cast in bronze, at their own or the public charge, and fitly placed in the hippodrome: they stood aloft in their chariots, wheeling round the goal: the spectators could admire their attitude, and judge of the resemblance; and of these figures, the most perfect might have been transported from the <NORP>Olympic</NORP> stadium.
 2.
 The sphinx, river-horse, and crocodile, denote the climate and manufacture of <GPE>Egypt</GPE> and the spoils of that ancient province.
 3.
 The she-wolf suckling <PERSON>Romulus</PERSON> and Remus, a subject alike pleasing to the old and the new Romans, but which could really be treated before the decline of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> sculpture.
 4.
 An eagle holding and tearing a serpent in his talons, a domestic monument of the Byzantines, which they ascribed, not to a human artist, but to the magic power of the philosopher Apollonius, who, by this talisman, delivered the city from such venomous reptiles.
 5.
 An ass and his driver, which were erected by <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> in his colony of Nicopolis, to commemorate a verbal omen of the victory of Actium.
 6.
 An equestrian statue which passed, in the vulgar opinion, for Joshua, the <NORP>Jewish</NORP> conqueror, stretching out his hand to stop the course of the descending sun.
 A more classical tradition recognized the figures of <PERSON>Bellerophon</PERSON> and Pegasus; and the free attitude of the steed seemed to mark that he trod on air, rather than on the earth.
 7.
 A square and lofty obelisk of brass; the sides were embossed with a variety of picturesque and rural scenes, birds singing; rustics laboring, or playing on their pipes; sheep bleating; lambs skipping; the sea, and a scene of fish and fishing; little naked cupids laughing, playing, and pelting each other with apples; and, on the summit, a female figure, turning with the slightest breath, and thence denominated the wind's attendant.
 8.
 The <NORP>Phrygian</NORP> shepherd presenting to Venus the prize of beauty, the apple of discord.
 9.
 The incomparable statue of Helen, which is delineated by <PERSON>Nicetas</PERSON> in the words of admiration and love: her well-turned feet, snowy arms, rosy lips, bewitching smiles, swimming eyes, arched eyebrows, the harmony of her shape, the lightness of her drapery, and her flowing locks that waved in the wind; a beauty that might have moved her <NORP>Barbarian</NORP> destroyers to pity and remorse.
 10.
 The manly or divine form of Hercules, (96) as he was restored to life by the masterhand of Lysippus; of such magnitude, that his thumb was equal to his waist, his leg to the stature, of a common man: (97) his chest ample, his shoulders broad, his limbs strong and muscular, his hair curled, his aspect commanding.
 Without his bow, or quiver, or club, his lion's skin carelessly thrown over him, he was seated on an osier basket, his right leg and arm stretched to the utmost, his left knee bent, and supporting his elbow, his head reclining on his left hand, his countenance indignant and pensive.
 11.
 A colossal statue of Juno, which had once adorned her temple of Samos, the enormous head by <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> yoke of oxen was laboriously drawn to the palace.
 12.
 Another colossus, of <PERSON>Pallas</PERSON> or Minerva, thirty feet in height, and representing with admirable spirit the attributes and character of the martial maid.
 Before we accuse the Latins, it is just to remark, that this <PERSON>Pallas</PERSON> was destroyed after the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> siege, by the fear and superstition of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> themselves.
 (98) The other statues of brass which I have enumerated were broken and melted by the unfeeling avarice of the crusaders: the cost and labour were consumed in a moment; the soul of genius evaporated in smoke; and the remnant of base metal was coined into money for the payment of the troops.
 Bronze is not the most durable of monuments: from the marble forms of <NORP>Phidias</NORP> and Praxiteles, the <NORP>Latins</NORP> might turn aside with stupid contempt; (99) but unless they were crushed by some accidental injury, those useless stones stood secure on their pedestals.
 (100) The most enlightened of the strangers, above the gross and sensual pursuits of their countrymen, more piously exercised the right of conquest in the search and seizure of the relics of the saints.
 (101) Immense was the supply of heads and bones, crosses and images, that were scattered by this revolution over the churches of Europe; and such was the increase of pilgrimage and oblation, that no branch, perhaps, of more lucrative plunder was imported from the East.
 (102) Of the writings of antiquity, many that still existed in the twelfth century, are now lost.
 But the pilgrims were not solicitous to save or transport the volumes of an unknown tongue: the perishable substance of paper or parchment can only be preserved by the multiplicity of copies; the literature of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> had almost centred in the metropolis; and, without computing the extent of our loss, we may drop a tear over the libraries that have perished in the triple fire of Constantinople.
