The state of <GPE>Germany</GPE> till the invasion of the Barbarians, in the time of the emperor Decius.
THE government and religion of <LOC>Persia</LOC> have deserved some notice from their connection with the decline and fall of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
 We shall occasionally mention the <NORP>Scythian</NORP> or <NORP>Sarmatian</NORP> tribes, which, with their arms and horses, their flocks and herbs, their wives and families wandered over the immense plains which spread themselves from the Caspian Sea to the <LOC>Vistulay</LOC> from the confines of <LOC>Persia</LOC> to those of Germany.
 But the warlike Germans, who <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> resisted, then invaded, and at length overturned, the western monarchy of Rome, will occupy a much more important place in this history, and possess a stronger, and, if we may use the expression, a more domestic, claim to our attention and regard.
 The most civilised nations of modern <LOC>Europe</LOC> issued from the woods of Germany, and in the rude institutions of those barbarians we may still distinguish the original principles of our present laws and manners.
 In their primitive state of simplicity and independence the <NORP>Germans</NORP> were surveyed by the discerning eye, and delineated by the masterly pencil, of Tacitus, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> of historians who applied the science of philosophy to the study of facts.
 The expressive conciseness of his descriptions has deserved to exercise the diligence of innumerable antiquarians, and to excite the genius and penetration of the philosophic historians of our own times.
 The subject, however, various and important, has already been so frequently, so ably, and so successfully discussed, that it is now grown familiar to the reader, and difficult to the writer.
 We shall therefore content ourselves with observing, and indeed with repeating, some of the most important circumstances of climate, of manners, and of institutions, which rendered the wild barbarians of <GPE>Germany</GPE> such formidable enemies to the <NORP>Roman</NORP> power.
 Extent of <GPE>Germany</GPE> Ancient Germany, excluding from its independent limits the province westward of the Rhine, which had submitted to the <NORP>Roman</NORP> yoke, extended itself over a <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> part of Europe.
 Almost the whole of modern Germany, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Livonia, Prussia, and the greater part of Poland, were peopled by the various tribes of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> great nation, whose complexion, manners, and language denoted a common origin and preserved a striking resemblance.
 On the west, ancient <GPE>Germany</GPE> was divided by the <LOC>Rhine</LOC> from the Gallic, and on the south by the <LOC>Danube</LOC> from the Illyrian, provinces of the empire.
 A ridge of hills, rising from the Danube, and called the Carpathian mountains, covered <GPE>Germany</GPE> on the side of <GPE>Dacia</GPE> or Hungary.
 The eastern frontier was faintly marked by the mutual fears of the <NORP>Germans</NORP> and the Sarmatians, and was often confounded by the mixture of warring and confederating tribes of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> nations.
 In the remote darkness of the north, the ancients imperfectly described a frozen ocean that lay beyond the <LOC>Baltic</LOC> Sea, and beyond the Peninsula, or islands, (1) of Scandinavia.
 Climate Some ingenious writers (2) have suspected that <LOC>Europe</LOC> was much colder formerly than it is at present; and the most ancient descriptions of the climate of <GPE>Germany</GPE> tend exceedingly to confirm their theory.
 The general complaints of intense frost, and eternal winter, are perhaps little to be regarded, since we have no method of reducing to the accurate standard of the thermometer the feelings or the expressions of an orator, born in the happier regions of <GPE>Greece</GPE> or Asia.
 But I shall select <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> remarkable circumstances of a less equivocal nature.
 1.
 The great rivers which covered the <NORP>Roman</NORP> provinces, the <LOC>Rhine</LOC> and the Danube, were frequently frozen over, and capable of supporting the most enormous weights.
 The barbarians, who often chose that severe season for their inroads, transported, without apprehension or danger, their numerous armies, their cavalry, and their heavy wagons, over a vast and solid bridge of ice.
 (3) Modern ages have not presented an instance of a like phenomenon.
 2.
 The reindeer, that useful animal, from whom the savage of the <LOC>North</LOC> derives the best comforts of his dreary life, is of a constitution that supports, and even requires, the most intense cold.
 He is found on the rock of Spitzberg, within ten degrees of the Pole; he seems to delight in the snows of <LOC>Lapland</LOC> and Siberia; but at present he cannot subsist, much less multiply, in any country to the south of the Baltic.
 (4) In the time of Caesar, the reindeer, as well as the elk and the wild bull, was a native of the <NORP>Hercynian</NORP> forest, which then overshadowed a great part of <GPE>Germany</GPE> and Poland.
 (5) The modern improvements sufficiently explain the causes of the diminution of the cold.
 These immense woods have been gradually cleared, which intercepted from the earth the rays of the sun.
 (6) The morasses have been drained, and, in proportion as the soil has been cultivated, the air has become more temperate.
 Canada, at this day, is an exact picture of ancient Germany.
 Although situated in the same parallel with the finest provinces of <GPE>France</GPE> and England, that country experiences the most rigorous cold.
 The reindeer are very numerous, the ground is covered with deep and lasting snow, and the great river of St.
 Laurence is regularly frozen, in a season when the waters of the <LOC>Seine</LOC> and the <LOC>Thames</LOC> are usually free from ice.
 (7) Its effects on the natives It is difficult to ascertain, and easy to exaggerate, the influence of the climate of ancient <GPE>Germany</GPE> over the minds and bodies of the natives.
 Many writers have supposed, and most have allowed, though, as it should seem, without any adequate proof, that the rigorous cold of the <LOC>North</LOC> was favourable to long life and generative vigour, that the women were more fruitful, and the human species more prolific, than in warmer or more temperate climates.
 (8) We may assert, with greater confidence, that the keen air of <GPE>Germany</GPE> formed the large and masculine limbs of the natives, who were, in general, of a more lofty stature than the people of the South, (9) gave them a kind of strength better adapted to violent exertions than to patient labour, and inspired them with constitutional bravery, which is the result of nerves and spirits.
 The severity of a <DATE>winter</DATE> campaign, that chilled the courage of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> troops, was scarcely felt by these hardy children of the North, (10) who in their turn were unable to resist the summer heats, and dissolved away in languor and sickness under the beams of an <NORP>Italian</NORP> sun.
 (11) Origin of the <NORP>Germans</NORP> There is not anywhere upon the globe a large tract of country which we have discovered destitute of inhabitants, or whose <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> population can be fixed with any degree of historical certainty.
 And yet, as the most philosophic minds can seldom refrain from investigating the infancy of great nations, our curiosity consumes itself in toilsome and disappointed efforts.
 When <PERSON>Tacitus</PERSON> considered the purity of the <NORP>German</NORP> blood, and the forbidding aspect of the country, he was disposed to pronounce those barbarians Indigenae, or natives of the soil.
 We may allow with safety, and perhaps with truth, that ancient <GPE>Germany</GPE> was not originally peopled by any foreign colonies already formed into a political society; (12) but that the name and nation received their existence from the gradual union of some wandering savages of the <NORP>Hercynian</NORP> woods.
 To assert those savages to have been the spontaneous production of the earth which they inhabited would be a rash inference, condemned by religion and unwarranted by reason.
 Fables and conjectures Such rational doubt is but ill-suited with the genius of popular vanity.
 Among the nations who have adopted the <NORP>Mosaic</NORP> history of the world, the ark of <PERSON>Noah</PERSON> has been of the same use as was formerly to the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and <NORP>Romans</NORP> the siege of Troy.
 On a narrow basis of acknowledged truth an immense but rude superstructure of fable has been erected, and the wild Irishman, (13) as well as the wild Tartar, (14) could point out the individual son of Japhet, from whose loins his ancestors were lineally descended.
 The last century abounded with antiquarians of profound learning and easy faith, who by the dim light of legends and traditions, of conjectures and etymologies, conducted the great-grand-children of <PERSON>Noah</PERSON> from the tower of <FAC>Babel</FAC> to the extremities of the globe.
 Of these judicious critics, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the most entertaining was Olaus Rudbeck, professor in the University of Upsal.
 (15) Whatever is celebrated, either in history or fable, this zealous patriot ascribes to his country.
 From <GPE>Sweden</GPE> (which formed so considerable a part of ancient Germany) the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> themselves derived their alphabetical characters, their astronomy, and their religion.
 Of that delightful region (for such it appeared to the eyes of a native) the <LOC>Atlantis</LOC> of Plato, the country of the Hyperboreans, the gardens of the Hesperides, the Fortunate Islands, and even the Elysian Fields, were all but faint and imperfect transcripts.
 A clime so profusely favoured by <ORG>Nature</ORG> could not long remain desert after the flood.
 The learned <PRODUCT>Rudbeck</PRODUCT> allows the family of <PERSON>Noah</PERSON> a few years to multiply from <CARDINAL>eight</CARDINAL> to about twenty thousand persons.
 He then disperses them into small colonies to replenish the earth and to propagate the human species.
 The <NORP>German</NORP> or <NORP>Swedish</NORP> detachment (which marched, if I am not mistaken, under the command of Askenaz, the son of Gomer, the son of Japhet) distinguished itself by a more than common diligence in the prosecution of this great work.
 The northern hive cast its swarms over the greatest part of Europe, Africa, and Asia; and (to use the author's metaphor) the blood circulated from the extremities to the heart.
 The <NORP>Germans</NORP> ignorant of letters; But all this well-laboured system of <NORP>German</NORP> antiquities is annihilated by a single fact, too well attested to admit of any doubt, and of too decisive a nature to leave room for any reply.
 The Germans, in the age of Tacitus, were unacquainted with the use of letters; (16) and the use of letters is the principal circumstance that distinguishes a civilized people from a herd of savages incapable of knowledge or reflection.
 Without that artificial help, the human memory soon dissipates or corrupts the ideas intrusted to her charge; and the nobler faculties of the mind, no longer supplied with models or with materials, gradually forget their powers; the judgment becomes feeble and lethargic, the imagination languid or irregular.
 Fully to apprehend this important truth, let us attempt, in an improved society, to calculate the immense distance between the man of learning and the illiterate peasant.
 The former, by reading and reflection, multiplies his own experience, and lives in distant ages and remote countries; whilst the latter, rooted to a single spot, and confined to a few years of existence, surpasses, but very little, his fellow labourer the ox in the exercise of his mental faculties.
 The same, and even a greater, difference will be found between nations than between individuals; and we may safely pronounce that, without some species of writing, no people has ever preserved the faithful annals of their history, ever made any considerable progress in the abstract sciences, or ever possessed, in any tolerable degree of perfection, the useful and agreeable arts of life.
 of arts and agriculture; Of these arts, the ancient <NORP>Germans</NORP> were wretchedly destitute.
 They passed their lives in a state of ignorance and poverty, which it has pleased some declaimers to dignify with the appellation of virtuous simplicity.
 Modern <GPE>Germany</GPE> is said to contain about <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> thousand three hundred walled towns.
 (17) In a much wider extent of country, the geographer <PERSON>Ptolemy</PERSON> could discover no more than ninety places, which he decorates with the name of cities; (18) though according to our ideas, they would but ill deserve that splendid title.
 We can only suppose them to have been rude fortifications, constructed in the centre of the woods, and designed to secure the women, children, and cattle, whilst the warriors of the tribe marched out to repel a sudden invasion.
 (19) But <PERSON>Tacitus</PERSON> asserts, as a well-known fact, that the Germans, in his time, had no Cities; (20) and that they affected to despise the works of <NORP>Roman</NORP> industry as places of confinement rather than of security.
 (21) Their edifices were not even contiguous, or formed into regular villages; (22) each barbarian fixed his independent dwelling on the spot to which a plain, a wood or a stream of fresh water had induced him to give the preference.
 Neither stone, nor brick, nor tiles, were employed in these slight habitations.
 (23) They were indeed no more than low huts of a circular figure, built of rough timber, thatched with straw, and pierced at the top to leave a free passage for the smoke.
 In the most inclement winter, the hardy <NORP>German</NORP> was satisfied with a scanty garment made of the skin of some animal .
 The nations who dwelt towards the <LOC>North</LOC> clothed themselves in furs; and the women manufactured for their own use a coarse kind of linen.
 (24) The game of various sorts, with which the forests of <GPE>Germany</GPE> were plentifully stocked, supplied its inhabitants with food and exercise.
 (25) Their monstrous herds of cattle, less remarkable indeed for their beauty than for their utility, (26) formed the principal object of their wealth.
 A small quantity of corn was the only produce exacted from the earth: the use of orchards or artificial meadows was unknown to the Germans; nor can we expect any improvements in agriculture from a people whose property every year experienced a general change by a new division of the arable lands, and who, in that strange operation, avoided disputes by suffering a great part of their territory to lie waste and without tillage.
 (27) and of the use of metals.
 Gold, silver, and iron were extremely scarce in Germany.
 Its barbarous inhabitants wanted both skill and patience to investigate those rich veins of silver, which have so liberally rewarded the attention of the princes of <GPE>Brunswick</GPE> and Saxony.
 Sweden, which now supplies <LOC>Europe</LOC> with iron, was equally ignorant of its own riches; and the appearance of the arms of the <NORP>Germans</NORP> furnished a sufficient proof how little iron they were able to bestow on what they must have deemed the noblest use of that metal.
 The various transactions of peace and war had introduced some <NORP>Roman</NORP> coins (chiefly silver) among the borderers of the <LOC>Rhine</LOC> and Danube; but the more distant tribes were absolutely unacquainted with the use of money, carried on their confined traffic by the exchange of commodities, and prized their rude earthen vessels as of equal value with the silver vases, the presents of <GPE>Rome</GPE> to their princes and ambassadors.
 (28) To a mind capable of reflection, such leading facts convey more instruction than a tedious detail of subordinate circumstances.
 The value of money has been settled by general consent to express our wants and our property, as letters were invented to express our ideas; and both these institutions, by giving a more active energy to the powers and passions of human nature, have contributed to multiply the objects they were designed to represent.
 The use of gold and silver is in a great measure fictitious; but it would be impossible to enumerate the important and various services which agriculture, and all the arts, have received from iron, when tempered and fashioned by the operation of fire and the dexterous hand of man.
 Money, in a word, is the most universal incitement, iron the most powerful instrument, of human industry; and it is very difficult to conceive by what means a people, neither actuated by the <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> nor seconded by the other, could emerge from the grossest barbarism.
 (29) Their indolence If we contemplate a savage nation in any part of the globe, a supine indolence and carelessness of futurity will be found to constitute their general character.
 In a civilised state, every faculty of man is expanded and exercised; and the great chain of mutual dependence connects and embraces the several members of society.
 The most numerous portion of it is employed in constant and useful labour.
 The select few, placed by fortune above that necessity, can, however, fill up their time by the pursuits of interest or glory, by the improvement of their estate or of their understanding, by the duties, the pleasures, and even the follies of social life.
 The <NORP>Germans</NORP> were not possessed of their varied resources.
 The care of the house and family, the management of the land and cattle, were delegated to the old and the infirm, to women and slaves.
 The lazy warrior, destitute of every art that might employ his leisure hours, consumed his days and nights in the animal gratifications of sleep and food.
 And yet, by a wonderful diversity of <ORG>Nature</ORG> (according to the remark of a writer who had pierced into its darkest recesses), the same barbarians are by turns the most indolent and the most restless of mankind.
 They delight in sloth, they detest tranquillity.
 (30) The languid soul, oppressed with its own weight, anxiously required some new and powerful sensation; and war and danger were the only amusements adequate to its fierce temper.
 The sound that summoned the <NORP>German</NORP> to arms was grateful to his ear.
 It roused him from his uncomfortable lethargy, gave him an active pursuit, and, by strong exercise of the body, and violent emotions of the mind, restored him to a more lively sense of his existence.
 In the dull intervals of peace, these barbarians were immoderately addicted to deep gaming and excessive drinking; both of which, by different means, the <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> by inflaming their passions, the other by extinguishing their reason, alike relieved them from the pain of thinking.
 They gloried in passing whole days and nights at table; and the blood of friends and relations often stained their numerous and drunken assemblies.
 (31) Their debts of honour (for in that light they have transmitted to us those of play) they discharged with the most romantic fidelity.
 The desperate gamester, who had staked his person and liberty on a last throw of the dice, patiently submitted to the decision of fortune, and suffered himself to be bound, chastised, and sold into remote slavery, by his weaker but more lucky antagonist.
 (32) Their taste for strong liquors Strong beer, a liquor extracted with very little art from wheat or barley, and corrupted (as it is strongly expressed by Tacitus) into a certain semblance of wine, was sufficient for the gross purposes of <NORP>German</NORP> debauchery.
 But those who had tasted the rich wines of Italy, and afterwards of Gaul, sighed for that more delicious species of intoxication.
 They attempted not, however (as has since been executed with so much success), to naturalise the vine on the banks of the <LOC>Rhine</LOC> and Danube; nor did they endeavour to procure by industry the materials of an advantageous commerce.
 To solicit by labour what might be ravished by arms was esteemed unworthy of the <NORP>German</NORP> spirit.
 (33) The intemperate thirst of strong liquors often urged the barbarians to invade the provinces on which art or nature had bestowed those much envied presents.
 The <NORP>Tuscan</NORP> who betrayed his country to the <NORP>Celtic</NORP> nations attracted them into <GPE>Italy</GPE> by the prospect of the rich fruits and delicious wines, the productions of a happier climate.
 (34) And in the same manner the <NORP>German</NORP> auxiliaries, invited into <GPE>France</GPE> during the civil wars of the sixteenth century, were allured by the promise of plenteous quarters in the provinces of <GPE>Champagne</GPE> and Burgundy.
 (35) Drunkenness, the most illiberal, but not the most dangerous, of our vices, was sometimes capable, in a less civilised state of mankind, of occasioning a battle, a war, or a revolution.
 State of population.
 The climate of ancient <GPE>Germany</GPE> had been mollified, and the soil fertilised, by the labour of ten centuries from the time of Charlemagne.
 The same extent of ground which at present maintains, in ease and plenty, a <CARDINAL>million</CARDINAL> of husbandmen and artificers, was unable to supply an hundred thousand lazy warriors with the simple necessaries of life.
 (36) The <NORP>Germans</NORP> abandoned their immense forests to the exercise of hunting, employed in pasturage the most considerable part of their lands, bestowed on the small remainder a rude and careless cultivation, and then accused the scantiness and sterility of a country that refused to maintain the multitude of its inhabitants.
 When the return of famine severely admonished them of the importance of the arts, the national distress was sometimes alleviated by the emigration of a third, perhaps, or a <ORDINAL>fourth</ORDINAL> part of their youth.
 (37) The possession and the enjoyment of property are the pledges which bind a civilised people to an improved country.
 But the Germans, who carried with them what they most valued, their arms, their cattle, and their women, cheerfully abandoned the vast silence of their woods for the unbounded hopes of plunder and conquest.
 The innumerable swarms that issued, or seemed to issue, from the great storehouse of nations, were multiplied by the fears of the vanquished and by the credulity of succeeding ages.
 And from facts thus exaggerated, an opinion was gradually established, and has been supported by writers of distinguished reputation, that, in the age of <PERSON>Caesar</PERSON> and Tacitus, the inhabitants of the <LOC>North</LOC> were far more numerous than they are in our days.
 (38) A more serious inquiry into the causes of population seems to have convinced modern philosophers of the falsehood, and indeed the impossibility, of the supposition.
 To the names of <PERSON>Mariana</PERSON> and of Machiavel, (39) we can oppose the equal names of <PERSON>Robertson</PERSON> and Hume.
 (40) <NORP>German</NORP> freedom A warlike nation like the Germans, without either cities, letters, arts, or money, found some compensation for this savage state in the enjoyment of liberty.
 Their poverty secured their freedom, since our desires and our possessions are the strongest fetters of despotism.
 In the mention of these exceptions, the great historian sufficiently acknowledges the general theory of government.
 We are only at a loss to conceive by what means riches and despotism could penetrate into a remote corner of the North, and extinguish the generous flame that blazed with such fierceness on the frontier of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> provinces: or how the ancestors of those <NORP>Danes</NORP> and Norwegians, so distinguished in latter ages by their unconquered spirit, could thus tamely resign the great character of <NORP>German</NORP> liberty.
 (42) Some tribes, however, on the coast of the Baltic, acknowledged the authority of kings, though without relinquishing the rights of men; (43) but in the far greater part of Germany, the form of government was a democracy tempered indeed, and controlled, not so much by general and positive laws, as by the occasional ascendant of birth or valour, of eloquence or superstition.
 (44) Assemblies of the people Civil governments, in their <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> institutions, are voluntary associations for mutual defence.
 To obtain the desired end, it is absolutely necessary that each individual should conceive himself obliged to submit his private opinion and actions to the judgment of the greater number of his associates.
 The <NORP>German</NORP> tribes were contented with this rude but liberal outline of political society.
 As soon as a youth, born of free parents, had attained the age of manhood, he was introduced into the general council of his countrymen, solemnly invested with a shield and spear, and adopted as an equal and worthy member of the military commonwealth.
 The assembly of the warriors of the tribe was convened at stated <DATE>seasons</DATE> or on sudden emergencies.
 The trial of public offences, the election of magistrates, and the great business of peace and war, were determined by its independent voice.
 Sometimes, indeed, these important questions were previously considered and prepared in a more select council of the principal chieftains.
 (45) The magistrates might deliberate and persuade, the people only could resolve and execute; and the resolutions of the <NORP>Germans</NORP> were for the most part hasty and violent.
 <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> accustomed to place their freedom in gratifying the present passion, and their courage in overlooking all future consequences, turned away with indignant contempt from the remonstrance of justice and policy, and it was the practice to signify by a hollow murmur their dislike of such timid counsels.
 But whenever a more popular orator proposed to vindicate the meanest citizen from either foreign or domestic injury, whenever he called upon his fellow-countrymen to assert the national honour, or to pursue some enterprise full of danger and glory, a loud clashing of shields and spears expressed the eager applause of the assembly.
 For the <NORP>Germans</NORP> always met in arms, and it was constantly to be dreaded lest an irregular multitude, inflamed with faction and strong liquors, should use those arms to enforce, as well as to declare, their furious resolves.
 We may recollect how often the diets of <GPE>Poland</GPE> have been polluted with blood, and the more numerous party has been compelled to yield to the more violent and seditious.
 (46) Authority of the princes and magistrates A general of the tribe was elected on occasions of danger; and, if the danger was pressing and extensive, several tribes concurred in the choice of the same general.
 The bravest warrior was named to lead his countrymen into the field by his example rather than by his commands.
 But this power, however limited, was still invidious.
 It expired with the war, and in time of peace the <NORP>German</NORP> tribes acknowledged not any supreme chief.
 (47) Princes were, however, appointed in the general assembly, to administer justice, or rather to compose differences, (48) in their respective districts.
 In the choice of these magistrates as much regard was shown to birth as to merit.
 (49) To each was assigned, by the public, a guard and a council of an hundred persons and the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> of the princes appears to have enjoyed a pre-eminence of rank and honour which sometimes tempted the <NORP>Romans</NORP> to compliment him with the regal title.
 (50) more absolute over the property than over the person of the <NORP>Germans</NORP> The comparative view of the powers of the magistrates, in <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> remarkable instances, is alone sufficient to represent the whole system of <NORP>German</NORP> manners.
 The disposal of the landed property within their district was absolutely vested in their hands, and they distributed it every year according to a new division.
 (51) At the same time they were not authorised to punish with death, to imprison, or even to strike, a private citizen.
 (52) A people thus jealous of their persons, and careless of their possessions, must have been totally destitute of industry and the arts, but animated with a high sense of honour and independence.
 Voluntary engagements The <NORP>Germans</NORP> respected only those duties which they imposed on themselves.
 The most obscure soldier resisted with disdain the authority of the magistrates.
 This institution, however it might accidentally weaken the several republics, invigorated the general character of the Germans, and even ripened amongst them all the virtues of which barbarians are susceptible; the faith and valour, the hospitality and the courtesy, so conspicuous long afterwards in the ages of chivalry.
 The honourable gifts, bestowed by the chief on his brave companions, have been supposed, by an ingenious writer, to contain the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> rudiments of the fiefs, distributed, after the conquest of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> provinces by the barbarian lords among their vassals with a similar duty of homage and military service.
 (54) These conditions are, however, very repugnant to the maxims of the ancient Germans, who delighted in mutual presents; but without either imposing, or accepting, the weight of obligations.
 (55) <NORP>German</NORP> chastity "In the days of chivalry, or more properly of romance, all the men were brave, and all the women were chaste ;" and notwithstanding the latter of these virtues is acquired and preserved with much more difficulty than the former, it is ascribed, almost without exception, to the wives of the ancient Germans.
 Polygamy was not in use, except among the princes, and among them only for the sake of multiplying their alliances.
 Divorces were prohibited by manners rather than by laws.
 Adulteries were punished as rare and inexpiable crimes; nor was seduction justified by example and fashion.
 (56) We may easily discover that <PERSON>Tacitus</PERSON> indulges an honest pleasure in the contrast of barbarian virtue with the dissolute conduct of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> ladies; yet there are some striking circumstances that give an air of truth, or at least of probability, to the conjugal faith and chastity of the Germans.
 Its probable causes Although the progress of civilisation has undoubtedly contributed to assuage the fiercer passions of human nature, it seems to have been less favourable to the virtue of chastity, whose most dangerous enemy is the softness of the mind.
 The refinements of life corrupt while they polish the intercourse of the sexes.
 The gross appetite of love becomes most dangerous when it is elevated, or rather, indeed, disguised by sentimental passion.
 The elegance of dress, of motion, and of manners gives a lustre to beauty, and inflames the senses through the imagination.
 Luxurious entertainments, midnight dances, and licentious spectacles, present at once temptations and opportunity to female frailty.
 (57) From such dangers the unpolished wives of the barbarians were secured by poverty, solitude, and the painful cares of a domestic life.
 The <NORP>German</NORP> huts, open on every side to the eye of indiscretion or jealousy, were a better safeguard of conjugal fidelity than the walls, the bolts, and the eunuchs of a <NORP>Persian</NORP> harem.
 To this reason, another may be added of a more honourable nature.
 The <NORP>Germans</NORP> treated their women with esteem and confidence, consulted them on every occasion of importance, and fondly believed that in their breasts resided a sanctity and wisdom more than human.
 Some of these interpreters of fate, such as Velleda, in the <NORP>Batavian</NORP> war, governed, in the name of the deity, the fiercest nations of Germany.
 (58) The rest of the sex, without being adored as goddesses, were respected as the free and equal companions of soldiers; associated even by the marriage ceremony to a life of toil, of danger, and of glory.
 (59) In their great invasions, the camps of the barbarians were filled with a multitude of women, who remained firm and undaunted amidst the sound of arms, the various forms of destruction, and the honourable wounds of their sons and husbands.
 (60) Fainting armies of <NORP>Germans</NORP> have more than once been driven back upon the enemy by the generous despair of the women who dreaded death much less than servitude.
 If the day was irrecoverably lost, they well knew how to deliver themselves and their children, with their own hands, from an insulting victor (61) .
 Heroines of such a cast may claim our admiration; but they were most assuredly neither lovely, nor very susceptible of love.
 Whilst they affected to emulate the stern virtues of man, they must have resigned that attractive softness in which principally consists the charm of woman.
 Conscious pride taught the <NORP>German</NORP> females to suppress every tender emotion that stood in competition with honour, and the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> honour of the sex has ever been that of chastity.
 The sentiments and conduct of these high-spirited matrons may, at once, be considered as a cause, as an effect, and as a proof of the general character of the nation.
 Female courage, however it may be raised by fanaticism, or confirmed by habit, can be only a faint and imperfect imitation of the manly valour that distinguishes the age or country in which it may be found.
 Religion The religious system of the <NORP>Germans</NORP> (if the wild opinions of savages can deserve that name) was dictated by their wants, their fears, and their ignorance.
 (62) They adored the great visible objects and agents of nature, the <LOC>Sun</LOC> and the Moon, the Fire and the Earth; together with those imaginary deities, who were supposed to preside over the most important occupations of human life.
 They were persuaded that, by some ridiculous arts of divination, they could discover the will of the superior beings, and that human sacrifices were the most precious and acceptable offering to their altars.
 Some applause has been hastily bestowed on the sublime notion, entertained by that people, of the Deity, whom they neither confined within the walls of a temple, nor represented by any human figure; but when we recollect that the <NORP>Germans</NORP> were unskilled in architecture, and totally unacquainted with the art of sculpture, we shall readily assign the true reason of a scruple which arose not so much from a superiority of reason as from a want of ingenuity.
 The only temples in <GPE>Germany</GPE> were dark and ancient groves, consecrated by the reverence of succeeding generations.
 Their secret gloom, the imagined residence of an invisible power, by presenting no distinct object of fear or worship, impressed the mind with a still deeper sense of religious horror; (63) and the priests, rude and illiterate as they were, had been taught by experience the use of every artifice that could preserve and fortify impressions so well suited to their own interest.
 Its effects in peace The same ignorance, which renders barbarians incapable of conceiving or embracing the useful restraints of laws, exposes them naked and unarmed to the blind terrors of superstition.
 The <NORP>German</NORP> priests, improving this favourable temper of their countrymen, had assumed a jurisdiction, even in temporal concerns, which the magistrate could not venture to exercise; and the haughty warrior patiently submitted to the lash of correction, when it was inflicted, not by any human power, but by the immediate order of the god of war.
 (64) The defects of civil policy were sometimes supplied by the interposition of ecclesiastical authority.
 The latter was constantly exerted to maintain silence and decency in the popular assemblies; and was sometimes extended to a more enlarged concern for the national welfare.
 A solemn procession was occasionally celebrated in the present countries of <GPE>Mecklenburgh</GPE> and Pomerania.
 The unknown symbol of the Earth, covered with a thick veil, was placed on a carriage drawn by cows; and in this manner the goddess, whose common residence was in the isle of Rugen, visited several adjacent tribes of her worshippers.
 During her progress the sound of war was hushed, quarrels were suspended, arms laid aside, and the restless <NORP>Germans</NORP> had an opportunity of tasting the blessings of peace and harmony.
 (65) The truce of God, so often and so ineffectually proclaimed by the clergy of the eleventh century, was an obvious imitation of this ancient custom.
 (66) in war But the influence of religion was far more powerful to inflame than to moderate the fierce passions of the Germans.
 Interest and fanaticism often prompted its ministers to sanctify the most daring and the most unjust enterprises, by the approbation of Heaven, and full assurances of success.
 The consecrated standards, long revered in the groves of superstition, were placed in the front of the battle; (67) and the hostile army was devoted with dire execrations to the gods of war and of thunder.
 (68) In the faith of soldiers (and such were the Germans) cowardice is the most unpardonable of sins.
 A brave man was the worthy favourite of their martial deities; the wretch, who had lost his shield, was alike banished from the religious and civil assemblies of his countrymen.
 Some tribes of the north seem to have embraced the doctrine of transmigration, (69) others imagined a gross paradise of immortal drunkenness.
 (70) All agreed that a life spent in arms, and a glorious death in battle, were the best preparations for a happy futurity either in this or in another world.
 The bards The immortality so vainly promised by the priests was in some degree conferred by the bards.
 That singular order of men has most deservedly attracted the notice of all who have attempted to investigate the antiquities of the Celts, the Scandinavians, and the Germans.
 Their genius and character, as well as the reverence paid to that important office, have been sufficiently illustrated.
 But we cannot so easily express, or even conceive, the enthusiasm of arms and glory, which they kindled in the breast of their audience.
 Among a polished people, a taste for poetry is rather an amusement of the fancy than a passion of the soul.
 And yet, when in calm retirement we peruse the combats described by <PERSON>Homer</PERSON> or Tasso, we are insensibly seduced by the fiction, and feel a momentary glow of martial ardour.
 But how faint, how cold is the sensation which a peaceful mind can receive from solitary study ! It was in the hour of battle, or in the feast of victory, that the bards celebrated the glory of heroes of ancient days, the ancestors of those warlike chieftains who listened with transport to their artless but animated strains.
 The view of arms and of danger heightened the effect of the military song; and the passions which it tended to excite, the desire of fame and the contempt of death, were the habitual sentiments of a <NORP>German</NORP> mind.
 (71) Causes which checked the progress of the <NORP>Germans</NORP> Such was the situation, and such were the manners, of the ancient Germans.
 Their climate, their want of learning, of arts, and of laws, their notions of honour, of gallantry, and of religion, their sense of freedom, impatience of peace, and thirst of enterprise, all contributed to form a people of military heroes.
 And yet we find that, during more than <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> hundred and fifty years that elapsed from the defeat of <PERSON>Varus</PERSON> to the reign of Decius, these formidable barbarians made few considerable attempts, and not any material impression on the luxurious and enslaved provinces of the empire.
 Their progress was checked by their want of arms and discipline, and their fury was diverted by the intestine divisions of ancient Germany.
 Want of arms I.
 It has been observed, with ingenuity, and; not without truth, that the command of iron soon gives a nation the command of gold.
 But the rude tribes of Germany, alike destitute of both those valuable metals, were reduced slowly to acquire, by their unassisted strength, the possession of the <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> as well as the other.
 The face of a <NORP>German</NORP> army displayed their poverty of iron.
 Swords, and the longer kind of lances, they could seldom use.
 Their frameae (as they called them in their own language) were long spears headed with a sharp but narrow iron point, and which, as occasion required, they either darted from a distance or pushed in close onset.
 With this spear, and with a shield, their cavalry was contented.
 A multitude of darts, scattered (72) with incredible force, were an additional resource of the infantry.
 Their military dress, when they wore any, was nothing more than a loose mantle.
 A variety of colours was the only ornament of their wooden or osier shields.
 Few of the chiefs were distinguished by cuirasses, scarce any by helmets.
 Though the horses of <GPE>Germany</GPE> were neither beautiful, swift, nor practised in the skilful evolutions of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> manege, several of the nations obtained renown by their cavalry; but, in general, the principal strength of the <NORP>Germans</NORP> consisted in their infantry, (73) which was drawn up in several deep columns, according to the distinction of tribes and families.
 and of discipline Impatient of fatigue or delay, these half-armed warriors rushed to battle with dissonant shouts and disordered ranks; and sometimes, by the effort of native valour, prevailed over the constrained and more artificial bravery of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> mercenaries.
 But as the barbarians poured forth their whole souls on the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> onset, they knew not how to rally or to retire.
 A repulse was a sure defeat; and a defeat was most commonly total destruction.
 When we recollect the complete armour of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> soldiers, their discipline, exercises, evolutions, fortified camps, and military engines, it appears a just matter of surprise how the naked and unassisted valour of the barbarians could dare to encounter in the field the strength of the legions, and the various troops of the auxiliaries which seconded their operations.
 The contest was too unequal, till the introduction of luxury had enervated the vigour, and a spirit of disobedience and sedition had relaxed the discipline, of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> armies.
 The introduction of barbarian auxiliaries into those armies was a measure attended with very obvious dangers, as it might gradually instruct the <NORP>Germans</NORP> in the arts of war and of policy.
 Although they were admitted in small numbers and with the strictest precaution, the example of <PERSON>Civilis</PERSON> was proper to convince the <NORP>Romans</NORP> that the danger was not imaginary, and that their precautions were not always sufficient.
 (74) During the civil wars that followed the death of Nero, that artful and intrepid Batavian, whom his enemies condescended to compare with <PERSON>Hannibal</PERSON> and Sertorius, (75) formed a great design of freedom and ambition.
 <CARDINAL>Eight</CARDINAL> <NORP>Batavian</NORP> cohorts, renowned in the wars of <GPE>Britain</GPE> and Italy, repaired to his standard.
 He introduced an army of <NORP>Germans</NORP> into Gaul, prevailed on the powerful cities of <LOC>Treves</LOC> and <GPE>Langres</GPE> to embrace his cause, defeated the legions, destroyed their fortified camps, and employed against the <NORP>Romans</NORP> the military knowledge which he had acquired in their service.
 When at length, after an obstinate struggle, he yielded to the power of the empire, <PERSON>Civilis</PERSON> secured himself and his country by an honourable treaty.
 The <NORP>Batavians</NORP> still continued to occupy the islands of the Rhine, (76) the allies not the servants of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> monarchy.
 Civil dissentions of <GPE>Germany</GPE> II.
 The strength of ancient <GPE>Germany</GPE> appears formidable when we consider the effects that might have been produced by its united effort.
 The wide extent of country might very possibly contain a <CARDINAL>million</CARDINAL> of warriors, as all who were of age to bear arms were of a temper to use them.
 But this fierce multitude, incapable of concerting or executing any plan of national greatness, was agitated by various and often hostile intentions.
 <GPE>Germany</GPE> was divided into more than forty independent states; and even in each state the union of the several tribes was extremely loose and precarious.
 The barbarians were easily provoked; they knew not how to forgive an injury, much less an insult; their resentments were bloody and implacable.
 The casual disputes that so frequently happened in their tumultuous parties of hunting or drinking were sufficient to inflame the minds of whole nations; the private feud of any considerable chieftains diffused itself among their followers and allies.
 To chastise the insolent, or to plunder the defenceless, were alike causes of war.
 The most formidable states of <GPE>Germany</GPE> affected to encompass their territories with a wide frontier of solitude and devastation.
 The awful distance preserved by their neighbours attested the terror of their arms, and in some measure defended them from the danger of unexpected incursions.
 (77) fomented by the policy of <GPE>Rome</GPE> These sentiments, less worthy of the humanity than of the patriotism of Tacitus, express the invariable maxims of the policy of his countrymen.
 They deemed it a much safer expedient to divide than to combat the barbarians, from whose defeat they could derive neither honour nor advantage.
 The money and negotiations of <GPE>Rome</GPE> insinuated themselves into the heart of Germany; and every art of seduction was used with dignity to conciliate those nations whom their proximity to the <LOC>Rhine</LOC> or <LOC>Danube</LOC> might render the most useful friends as well as the most troublesome enemies.
 Chiefs of renown and power were flattered by the most trifling presents, which they received either as marks of distinction, or as the instruments of luxury.
 In civil dissensions, the weaker faction endeavoured to strengthen its interest by entering into secret connections with the governors of the frontier provinces.
 Every quarrel among the <NORP>Germans</NORP> was fomented by the intrigues of Rome; and every plan of union and public good was defeated by the stronger bias of private jealousy and interest.
 (81) Transient union against <PERSON>Marcus</PERSON> Antoninus The general conspiracy which terrified the <NORP>Romans</NORP> under the reign of <PERSON>Marcus</PERSON> Antoninus comprehended almost all the nations of Germany, and even Sarmatia, from the mouth of the <LOC>Rhine</LOC> to that of the Danube.
 (82) It is impossible for us to determine whether this hasty confederation was formed by necessity, by reason, or by passion; but we may rest assured that the barbarians were neither allured by the indolence, nor provoked by the ambition, of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> monarch.
 This dangerous invasion required all the firmness and vigilance of Marcus.
 He fixed generals of ability in the several stations of attack, and assumed in person the conduct of the most important province on the Upper Danube.
 After a long and doubtful conflict, the spirit of the barbarians was subdued.
 The <NORP>Quadi</NORP> and the Marcomanni, (83) who had taken the lead in the war, were the most severely punished in its catastrophe.
 They were commanded to retire five miles (84) from their own banks of the Danube, and to deliver up the flower of the youth, who were immediately sent into Britain, a remote island, where they might be secure as hostages, and useful as soldiers.
 (85) On the frequent rebellions of the <NORP>Quadi</NORP> and Marcomanni, the irritated emperor resolved to reduce their country into the form of a province.
 His designs were disappointed by death.
 This formidable league, however, the only <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> that appears in the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> centuries of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> history, was entirely dissipated, without leaving any traces behind in Germany.
 Distinction of the <NORP>German</NORP> tribes In the course of this introductory chapter, we have confined ourselves to the general outlines of the manners of Germany, without attempting to describe or to distinguish the various tribes which filled the great country in the time of Caesar, of <PERSON>Tacitus</PERSON> or of Ptolemy.
 As the ancient, or as new tribes successively present themselves in the series of this history, we shall concisely mention their origin, their situation, and their particular character.
 Modern nations are fixed and permanent societies, connected among themselves by laws and government, bound to their native soil by arts and agriculture.
 The <NORP>German</NORP> tribes were voluntary and fluctuating associations of soldiers, almost of savages.
 The same territory often changed its inhabitants in the tide of conquest and emigration.
 The same communities, uniting in a plan of defence or invasion, bestowed a new title on their new confederacy.
 The dissolution of an ancient confederacy restored to the independent tribes their peculiar but long-forgotten appellation.
 A victorious state often communicated its own name to a vanquished people.
 Sometimes crowds of volunteers flocked from all parts to the standard of a favourite leader; his camp became their country, and some circumstance of the enterprise soon gave a common denomination to the mixed multitude.
 The distinctions of the ferocious invaders were perpetually varied by themselves, and confounded by the astonished subjects of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
 (86) Numbers Wars, and the administration of public affairs are the principal subjects of history; but the number of persons interested in these busy scenes is very different according to the different condition of mankind.
 In great monarchies <CARDINAL>millions</CARDINAL> of obedient subjects pursue their useful occupations in peace and obscurity.
 The attention of the writer, as well as of the reader, is solely confined to a court, a capital, a regular army, and the districts which happen to be the occasional scene of military operations.
 But a state of freedom and barbarism, the season of civil commotions, or the situation of petty republics, (87) raises almost every member of the community into action, and consequently into notice.
 The irregular divisions, and the restless motions, of the people of <GPE>Germany</GPE> dazzle our imagination and seem to multiply their numbers.
 The profuse enumeration of kings and warriors of armies and nations inclines us to forget that the same objects are continually repeated under a variety of appellations, and that the most splendid appellations have been frequently lavished on the most inconsiderable objects.
