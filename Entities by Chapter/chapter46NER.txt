 Victories and Triumph of HeracliusContest of <GPE>Rome</GPE> and <GPE>Persia</GPE> The conflict of <GPE>Rome</GPE> and <GPE>Persia</GPE> was prolonged from the death of <PERSON>Craesus</PERSON> to the reign of Heraclius.
 An experience of <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> years might convince the rival nations of the impossibility of maintaining their conquests beyond the fatal limits of the <LOC>Tigris</LOC> and Euphrates.
 Yet the emulation of <PERSON>Trajan</PERSON> and <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> was awakened by the trophies of Alexander, and the sovereigns of <GPE>Persia</GPE> indulged the ambitious hope of restoring the empire of Cyrus.
 (1) Such extraordinary efforts of power and courage will always command the attention of posterity; but the events by which the fate of nations is not materially changed, leave a faint impression on the page of history, and the patience of the reader would be exhausted by the repetition of the same hostilities, undertaken without cause, prosecuted without glory, and terminated without effect.
 The arts of negotiation, unknown to the simple greatness of the senate and the Caesars, were assiduously cultivated by the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> princes; and the memorials of their perpetual embassies (2) repeat, with the same uniform prolixity, the language of falsehood and declamation, the insolence of the Barbarians, and the servile temper of the tributary Greeks.
 Lamenting the barren superfluity of materials, I have studied to compress the narrative of these uninteresting transactions: but the just <PERSON>Nushirvan</PERSON> is still applauded as the model of <NORP>Oriental</NORP> kings, and the ambition of his grandson <PERSON>Chosroes</PERSON> prepared the revolution of the East, which was speedily accomplished by the arms and the religion of the successors of Mahomet.

D.
 570, etc In the useless altercations, that precede and justify the quarrels of princes, the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and the <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> accused each other of violating the peace which had been concluded between the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> empires about <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> years before the death of Justinian.
 The sovereign of <GPE>Persia</GPE> and <GPE>India</GPE> aspired to reduce under his obedience the province of <GPE>Yemen</GPE> or <GPE>Arabia</GPE> (3) Felix; the distant land of myrrh and frankincense, which had escaped, rather than opposed, the conquerors of the East.
 After the defeat of <PERSON>Abrahah</PERSON> under the walls of Mecca, the discord of his sons and brothers gave an easy entrance to the Persians: they chased the strangers of <GPE>Abyssinia</GPE> beyond the Red Sea; and a native prince of the ancient <NORP>Homerites</NORP> was restored to the throne as the vassal or viceroy of the great Nushirvan.
 (4) But the nephew of <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> declared his resolution to avenge the injuries of his <NORP>Christian</NORP> ally the prince of Abyssinia, as they suggested a decent pretence to discontinue the <DATE>annual</DATE> tribute, which was poorly disguised by the name of pension.
 The churches of <GPE>Persarmenia</GPE> were oppressed by the intolerant spirit of the Magi; they secretly invoked the protector of the Christians, and, after the pious murder of their satraps, the rebels were avowed and supported as the brethren and subjects of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> emperor.
 The complaints of <PERSON>Nushirvan</PERSON> were disregarded by the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> court; <PERSON>Justin</PERSON> yielded to the importunities of the Turks, who offered an alliance against the common enemy; and the <NORP>Persian</NORP> monarchy was threatened at the same instant by the united forces of Europe, of Aethiopia, and of Scythia.

 Nushirvan, or Chosroes, conducted in person the siege of Dara; and although that important fortress had been left destitute of troops and magazines, the valour of the inhabitants resisted above <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> months the archers, the elephants, and the military engines of the Great King.
 In the mean while his general <PERSON>Adarman</PERSON> advanced from Babylon, traversed the desert, passed the Euphrates, insulted the suburbs of Antioch, reduced to ashes the city of Apamea, and laid the spoils of <GPE>Syria</GPE> at the feet of his master, whose perseverance in the midst of <DATE>winter</DATE> at length subverted the bulwark of the East.
 But these losses, which astonished the provinces and the court, produced a salutary effect in the repentance and abdication of the emperor Justin: a new spirit arose in the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> councils; and a truce of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> years was obtained by the prudence of Tiberius.
 That seasonable interval was employed in the preparations of war; and the voice of rumour proclaimed to the world, that from the distant countries of the <LOC>Alps</LOC> and the Rhine, from Scythia, Maesia, Pannonia, Illyricum, and Isauria, the strength of the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> cavalry was reenforced with <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and fifty <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> soldiers.
 Yet the king of Persia, without fear, or without faith, resolved to prevent the attack of the enemy; again passed the Euphrates, and dismissing the ambassadors of Tiberius, arrogantly commanded them to await his arrival at Caesarea, the metropolis of the <NORP>Cappadocian</NORP> provinces.
 The <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> armies encountered each other in the battle of Melitene: the Barbarians, who darkened the air with a cloud of arrows, prolonged their line, and extended their wings across the plain; while the Romans, in deep and solid bodies, expected to prevail in closer action, by the weight of their swords and lances.
 A <NORP>Scythian</NORP> chief, who commanded their right wing, suddenly turned the flank of the enemy, attacked their rear-guard in the presence of Chosroes, penetrated to the midst of the camp, pillaged the royal tent, profaned the eternal fire, loaded a train of camels with the spoils of Asia, cut his way through the <NORP>Persian</NORP> host, and returned with songs of victory to his friends, who had consumed the day in single combats, or ineffectual skirmishes.
 The darkness of the night, and the separation of the Romans, afforded the <NORP>Persian</NORP> monarch an opportunity of revenge; and <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of their camps was swept away by a rapid and impetuous assault.
 But the review of his loss, and the consciousness of his danger, determined <PERSON>Chosroes</PERSON> to a speedy retreat: he burnt, in his passage, the vacant town of Melitene; and, without consulting the safety of his troops, boldly swam the <LOC>Euphrates</LOC> on the back of an elephant.
 After this unsuccessful campaign, the want of magazines, and perhaps some inroad of the Turks, obliged him to disband or divide his forces; the <NORP>Romans</NORP> were left masters of the field, and their general Justinian, advancing to the relief of the <NORP>Persarmenian</NORP> rebels, erected his standard on the banks of the Araxes.
 The great <PERSON>Pompey</PERSON> had formerly halted within <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> days' march of the Caspian: (5) that inland sea was explored, for the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> time, by a hostile fleet, (6) and seventy <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> captives were transplanted from <GPE>Hyrcania</GPE> to the Isle of Cyprus.

 the indignant monarch sunk into the grave; and his last edict restrained his successors from exposing their person in battle against the Romans.
 Yet the memory of this transient affront was lost in the glories of a long reign; and his formidable enemies, after indulging their dream of conquest, again solicited a short respite from the calamities of war.
 (7) Tyranny and vices of his son Hormouz, A.
D.
 579-590.
 The throne of <PERSON>Chosroes</PERSON> <PERSON>Nushirvan</PERSON> was filled by Hormouz, or Hormisdas, the eldest or the most favoured of his sons.
 With the kingdoms of <GPE>Persia</GPE> and India, he inherited the reputation and example of his father, the service, in every rank, of his wise and valiant officers, and a general system of administration, harmonized by time and political wisdom to promote the happiness of the prince and people.
 But the royal youth enjoyed a still more valuable blessing, the friendship of a sage who had presided over his education, and who always preferred the honour to the interest of his pupil, his interest to his inclination.
 In a dispute with the <NORP>Greek</NORP> and <NORP>Indian</NORP> philosophers, <PERSON>Buzurg</PERSON> (8) had once maintained, that the most grievous misfortune of life is old age without the remembrance of virtue; and our candor will presume that the same principle compelled him, during <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> years, to direct the councils of the <NORP>Persian</NORP> empire.
 His zeal was rewarded by the gratitude and docility of Hormouz, who acknowledged himself more indebted to his preceptor than to his parent: but when age and labor had impaired the strength, and perhaps the faculties, of this prudent counsellor, he retired from court, and abandoned the youthful monarch to his own passions and those of his favorites.
 By the fatal vicissitude of human affairs, the same scenes were renewed at Ctesiphon, which had been exhibited at <GPE>Rome</GPE> after the death of Marcus Antoninus.
 The ministers of flattery and corruption, who had been banished by his father, were recalled and cherished by the son; the disgrace and exile of the friends of <PERSON>Nushirvan</PERSON> established their tyranny; and virtue was driven by degrees from the mind of Hormouz, from his palace, and from the government of the state.
 The faithful agents, the eyes and ears of the king, informed him of the progress of disorder, that the provincial governors flew to their prey with the fierceness of lions and eagles, and that their rapine and injustice would teach the most loyal of his subjects to abhor the name and authority of their sovereign.
 The sincerity of this advice was punished with death; the murmurs of the cities were despised, their tumults were quelled by military execution: the intermediate powers between the throne and the people were abolished; and the childish vanity of Hormouz, who affected the daily use of the tiara, was fond of declaring, that he alone would be the judge as well as the master of his kingdom.
 In every word, and in every action, the son of <PERSON>Nushirvan</PERSON> degenerated from the virtues of his father.
 His avarice defrauded the troops; his jealous caprice degraded the satraps; the palace, the tribunals, the waters of the Tigris, were stained with the blood of the innocent, and the tyrant exulted in the sufferings and execution of thirteen <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> victims.
 As the excuse of his cruelty, he sometimes condescended to observe, that the fears of the <NORP>Persians</NORP> would be productive of hatred, and that their hatred must terminate in rebellion but he forgot that his own guilt and folly had inspired the sentiments which he deplored, and prepared the event which he so justly apprehended.
 Exasperated by long and hopeless oppression, the provinces of Babylon, Susa, and Carmania, erected the standard of revolt; and the princes of Arabia, India, and Scythia, refused the customary tribute to the unworthy successor of Nushirvan.
 The arms of the Romans, in slow sieges and frequent inroads, afflicted the frontiers of <GPE>Mesopotamia</GPE> and Assyria: <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of their generals professed himself the disciple of Scipio; and the soldiers were animated by a miraculous image of Christ, whose mild aspect should never have been displayed in the front of battle.
 (9) At the same time, the eastern provinces of <GPE>Persia</GPE> were invaded by the great khan, who passed the <PRODUCT>Oxus</PRODUCT> at the head of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> or <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> Turks.
 The imprudent <PERSON>Hormouz</PERSON> accepted their perfidious and formidable aid; the cities of <GPE>Khorassan</GPE> or <GPE>Bactriana</GPE> were commanded to open their gates the march of the <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> towards the mountains of <GPE>Hyrcania</GPE> revealed the correspondence of the <NORP>Turkish</NORP> and <NORP>Roman</NORP> arms; and their union must have subverted the throne of the house of Sassan.
 Exploits of Bahram, A.
D.
 590.
 <GPE>Persia</GPE> had been lost by a king; it was saved by a hero.
 After his revolt, <PERSON>Varanes</PERSON> or <GPE>Bahram</GPE> is stigmatized by the son of <PERSON>Hormouz</PERSON> as an ungrateful slave; the proud and ambiguous reproach of despotism, since he was truly descended from the ancient princes of Rei, (10) <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> families whose splendid, as well as substantial, prerogatives exalted them above the heads of the <NORP>Persian</NORP> nobility.
 (11) At the siege of Dara, the valour of <GPE>Bahram</GPE> was signalized under the eyes of Nushirvan, and both the father and son successively promoted him to the command of armies, the government of Media, and the superintendence of the palace.
 The popular prediction which marked him as the deliverer of Persia, might be inspired by his past victories and extraordinary figure: the epithet <PERSON>Giubin</PERSON> is expressive of the quality of dry wood: he had the strength and stature of a giant; and his savage countenance was fancifully compared to that of a wild cat.
 While the nation trembled, while <PERSON>Hormouz</PERSON> disguised his terror by the name of suspicion, and his servants concealed their disloyalty under the mask of fear, <GPE>Bahram</GPE> alone displayed his undaunted courage and apparent fidelity: and as soon as he found that no more than <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> soldiers would follow him against the enemy; he prudently declared, that to this fatal number Heaven had reserved the honours of the triumph.
 The steep and narrow descent of the Pule Rudbar, (12) or <NORP>Hyrcanian</NORP> rock, is the only pass through which an army can penetrate into the territory of <PERSON>Rei</PERSON> and the plains of Media.
 From the commanding heights, a band of resolute men might overwhelm with stones and darts the myriads of the <NORP>Turkish</NORP> host: their emperor and his son were transpierced with arrows; and the fugitives were left, without counsel or provisions, to the revenge of an injured people.
 The patriotism of the <NORP>Persian</NORP> general was stimulated by his affection for the city of his forefathers: in the hour of victory, every peasant became a soldier, and every soldier a hero; and their ardor was kindled by the gorgeous spectacle of beds, and thrones, and tables of massy gold, the spoils of Asia, and the luxury of the hostile camp.
 A prince of a less malignant temper could not easily have forgiven his benefactor; and the secret hatred of <PERSON>Hormouz</PERSON> was envenomed by a malicious report, that <GPE>Bahram</GPE> had privately retained the most precious fruits of his <NORP>Turkish</NORP> victory.
 But the approach of a <NORP>Roman</NORP> army on the side of the <NORP>Araxes</NORP> compelled the implacable tyrant to smile and to applaud; and the toils of <GPE>Bahram</GPE> were rewarded with the permission of encountering a new enemy, by their skill and discipline more formidable than a <NORP>Scythian</NORP> multitude.
 Elated by his recent success, he despatched a herald with a bold defiance to the camp of the Romans, requesting them to fix a day of battle, and to choose whether they would pass the river themselves, or allow a free passage to the arms of the great king.
 The lieutenant of the emperor <PERSON>Maurice</PERSON> preferred the safer alternative; and this local circumstance, which would have enhanced the victory of the Persians, rendered their defeat more bloody and their escape more difficult.
 But the loss of his subjects, and the danger of his kingdom, were overbalanced in the mind of <PERSON>Hormouz</PERSON> by the disgrace of his personal enemy; and no sooner had <GPE>Bahram</GPE> collected and reviewed his forces, than he received from a royal messenger the insulting gift of a distaff, a spinning-wheel, and a complete suit of female apparel.
 Obedient to the will of his sovereign he showed himself to the soldiers in this unworthy disguise they resented his ignominy and their own; a shout of rebellion ran through the ranks; and the general accepted their oath of fidelity and vows of revenge.
 A <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> messenger, who had been commanded to bring the rebel in chains, was trampled under the feet of an elephant, and manifestos were diligently circulated, His rebellion.
 exhorting the <NORP>Persians</NORP> to assert their freedom against an odious and contemptible tyrant.
 The defection was rapid and universal; his loyal slaves were sacrificed to the public fury; the troops deserted to the standard of Bahram; and the provinces again saluted the deliverer of his country.
 <PERSON>Hormouz</PERSON> is deposed and imprisoned.
 As the passes were faithfully guarded, <PERSON>Hormouz</PERSON> could only compute the number of his enemies by the testimony of a guilty conscience, and the daily defection of those who, in the hour of his distress, avenged their wrongs, or forgot their obligations.
 He proudly displayed the ensigns of royalty; but the city and palace of <GPE>Modain</GPE> had already escaped from the hand of the tyrant.
 Among the victims of his cruelty, Bindoes, a <NORP>Sassanian</NORP> prince, had been cast into a dungeon; his fetters were broken by the zeal and courage of a brother; and he stood before the king at the head of those trusty guards, who had been chosen as the ministers of his confinement, and perhaps of his death.
 Alarmed by the hasty intrusion and bold reproaches of the captive, <PERSON>Hormouz</PERSON> looked round, but in vain, for advice or assistance; discovered that his strength consisted in the obedience of others; and patiently yielded to the single arm of Bindoes, who dragged him from the throne to the same dungeon in which he himself had been so lately confined.
 At the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> tumult, Chosroes, the eldest of the sons of Hormouz, escaped from the city; he was persuaded to return by the pressing and friendly invitation of Bindoes, who promised to seat him on his father's throne, and who expected to reign under the name of an inexperienced youth.
 In the just assurance, that his accomplices could neither forgive nor hope to be forgiven, and that every <NORP>Persian</NORP> might be trusted as the judge and enemy of the tyrant, he instituted a public trial without a precedent and without a copy in the annals of the East.
 The son of Nushirvan, who had requested to plead in his own defence, was introduced as a criminal into the full assembly of the nobles and satraps.
 (13) He was heard with decent attention as long as he expatiated on the advantages of order and obedience, the danger of innovation, and the inevitable discord of those who had encouraged each other to trample on their lawful and hereditary sovereign.
 By a pathetic appeal to their humanity, he extorted that pity which is seldom refused to the fallen fortunes of a king; and while they beheld the abject posture and squalid appearance of the prisoner, his tears, his chains, and the marks of ignominious stripes, it was impossible to forget how recently they had adored the divine splendour of his diadem and purple.
 But an angry murmur arose in the assembly as soon as he presumed to vindicate his conduct, and to applaud the victories of his reign.
 He defined the duties of a king, and the <NORP>Persian</NORP> nobles listened with a smile of contempt; they were fired with indignation when he dared to vilify the character of Chosroes; and by the indiscreet offer of resigning the sceptre to the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> of his sons, he subscribed his own condemnation, and sacrificed the life of his own innocent favorite.
 The mangled bodies of the boy and his mother were exposed to the people; the eyes of <PERSON>Hormouz</PERSON> were pierced with a hot needle; Elevation of his son Chosroes.
 and the punishment of the father was succeeded by the coronation of his eldest son.
 <PERSON>Chosroes</PERSON> had ascended the throne without guilt, and his piety strove to alleviate the misery of the abdicated monarch; from the dungeon he removed <PERSON>Hormouz</PERSON> to an apartment of the palace, supplied with liberality the consolations of sensual enjoyment, and patiently endured the furious sallies of his resentment and despair.
 He might despise the resentment of a blind and unpopular tyrant, but the tiara was trembling on his head, till he could subvert the power, or acquire the friendship, of the great Bahram, who sternly denied the justice of a revolution, in which himself and his soldiers, the true representatives of Persia, had never been consulted.
 The offer of a general amnesty, and of the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> rank in his kingdom, was answered by an epistle from Bahram, friend of the gods, conqueror of men, and enemy of tyrants, the satrap of satraps, general of the <NORP>Persian</NORP> armies, and a prince adorned with the title of <CARDINAL>eleven</CARDINAL> virtues.
 (14) He commands Chosroes, the son of Hormouz, to shun the example and fate of his father, to confine the traitors who had been released from their chains, to deposit in some holy place the diadem which he had usurped, and to accept from his gracious benefactor the pardon of his faults and the government of a province.
 The rebel might not be proud, and the king most assuredly was not humble; but the <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> was conscious of his strength, the other was sensible of his weakness; and even the modest language of his reply still left room for treaty and reconciliation.
 <PERSON>Chosroes</PERSON> led into the field the slaves of the palace and the populace of the capital: they beheld with terror the banners of a veteran army; they were encompassed and surprised by the evolutions of the general; and the satraps who had deposed Hormouz, received the punishment of their revolt, or expiated their <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> treason by a <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> and more criminal act of disloyalty.
 The life and liberty of <PERSON>Chosroes</PERSON> were saved, but he was reduced to the necessity of imploring aid or refuge in some foreign land; Death of Hormouz, A.
D.

 and the implacable Bindoes, anxious to secure an unquestionable title, hastily returned to the palace, and ended, with a bowstring, the wretched existence of the son of Nushirvan.
 (15) <PERSON>Chosroes</PERSON> flies to the Romans.
 While <PERSON>Chosroes</PERSON> despatched the preparations of his retreat, he deliberated with his remaining friends, (16) whether he should lurk in the valleys of Mount Caucasus, or fly to the tents of the Turks, or solicit the protection of the emperor.
 The long emulation of the successors of <PERSON>Artaxerxes</PERSON> and <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> increased his reluctance to appear as a suppliant in a rival court; but he weighed the forces of the Romans, and prudently considered that the neighbourhood of <GPE>Syria</GPE> would render his escape more easy and their succors more effectual.
 Attended only by his concubines, and a troop of <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> guards, he secretly departed from the capital, followed the banks of the Euphrates, traversed the desert, and halted at the distance of ten miles from Circesium.
 About the <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> watch of the night, the <NORP>Roman</NORP> praefect was informed of his approach, and he introduced the royal stranger to the fortress at the dawn of day.
 From thence the king of <GPE>Persia</GPE> was conducted to the more honourable residence of Hierapolis; and <PERSON>Maurice</PERSON> dissembled his pride, and displayed his benevolence, at the reception of the letters and ambassadors of the grandson of Nushirvan.
 They humbly represented the vicissitudes of fortune and the common interest of princes, exaggerated the ingratitude of Bahram, the agent of the evil principle, and urged, with specious argument, that it was for the advantage of the <NORP>Romans</NORP> themselves to support the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> monarchies which balance the world, the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> great luminaries by whose salutary influence it is vivified and adorned.
 The anxiety of <PERSON>Chosroes</PERSON> was soon relieved by the assurance, that the emperor had espoused the cause of justice and royalty; but <PERSON>Maurice</PERSON> prudently declined the expense and delay of his useless visit to Constantinople.
 In the name of his generous benefactor, a rich diadem was presented to the fugitive prince, with an inestimable gift of jewels and gold; a powerful army was assembled on the frontiers of <GPE>Syria</GPE> and Armenia, under the command of the valiant and faithful Narses, (17) and this general, of his own nation, and his own choice, was directed to pass the Tigris, and never to sheathe his sword till he had restored <PERSON>Chosroes</PERSON> to the throne of his ancestors.
 The enterprise, however splendid, was less arduous than it might appear.
 His return.
 <GPE>Persia</GPE> had already repented of her fatal rashness, which betrayed the heir of the house of <PERSON>Sassan</PERSON> to the ambition of a rebellious subject: and the bold refusal of the <PERSON>Magi</PERSON> to consecrate his usurpation, compelled <GPE>Bahram</GPE> to assume the sceptre, regardless of the laws and prejudices of the nation.
 The palace was soon distracted with conspiracy, the city with tumult, the provinces with insurrection; and the cruel execution of the guilty and the suspected served to irritate rather than subdue the public discontent.
 No sooner did the grandson of <PERSON>Nushirvan</PERSON> display his own and the <NORP>Roman</NORP> banners beyond the Tigris, than he was joined, each day, by the increasing multitudes of the nobility and people; and as he advanced, he received from every side the grateful offerings of the keys of his cities and the heads of his enemies.
 As soon as <GPE>Modain</GPE> was freed from the presence of the usurper, the loyal inhabitants obeyed the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> summons of <PERSON>Mebodes</PERSON> at the head of only <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> horse, and <PERSON>Chosroes</PERSON> accepted the sacred and precious ornaments of the palace as the pledge of their truth and the presage of his approaching success.
 After the junction of the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> troops, which <GPE>Bahram</GPE> vainly struggled to prevent, the contest was decided by <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> battles on the banks of the Zab, and the confines of Media.
 and final victory.
 The Romans, with the faithful subjects of Persia, amounted to sixty thousand, while the whole force of the usurper did not exceed forty <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> men: the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> generals signalized their valour and ability; but the victory was finally determined by the prevalence of numbers and discipline.
Death of Bahram.
 With the remnant of a broken army, <GPE>Bahram</GPE> fled towards the eastern provinces of the Oxus: the enmity of <GPE>Persia</GPE> reconciled him to the Turks; but his days were shortened by poison, perhaps the most incurable of poisons; the stings of remorse and despair, and the bitter remembrance of lost glory.
 Yet the modern <NORP>Persians</NORP> still commemorate the exploits of Bahram; and some excellent laws have prolonged the duration of his troubled and transitory reign.
 Restoration and policy of Chosroes, A.
D.
 591-603.
 The restoration of <PERSON>Chosroes</PERSON> was celebrated with feasts and executions; and the music of the royal banquet was often disturbed by the groans of dying or mutilated criminals.
 A general pardon might have diffused comfort and tranquillity through a country which had been shaken by the late revolutions; yet, before the sanguinary temper of <PERSON>Chosroes</PERSON> is blamed, we should learn whether the <NORP>Persians</NORP> had not been accustomed either to dread the rigour, or to despise the weakness, of their sovereign.
 The revolt of Bahram, and the conspiracy of the satraps, were impartially punished by the revenge or justice of the conqueror; the merits of <PERSON>Bindoes</PERSON> himself could not purify his hand from the guilt of royal blood: and the son of <PERSON>Hormouz</PERSON> was desirous to assert his own innocence, and to vindicate the sanctity of kings.
 During the vigour of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> power, several princes were seated on the throne of <GPE>Persia</GPE> by the arms and the authority of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> Caesars.
 But their new subjects were soon disgusted with the vices or virtues which they had imbibed in a foreign land; the instability of their dominion gave birth to a vulgar observation, that the choice of <GPE>Rome</GPE> was solicited and rejected with equal ardor by the capricious levity of <NORP>Oriental</NORP> slaves.
 (18) But the glory of <PERSON>Maurice</PERSON> was conspicuous in the long and fortunate reign of his son and his ally.
 A band of a <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> Romans, who continued to guard the person of Chosroes, proclaimed his confidence in the fidelity of the strangers; his growing strength enabled him to dismiss this unpopular aid, but he steadily professed the same gratitude and reverence to his adopted father; and till the death of Maurice, the peace and alliance of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> empires were faithfully maintained.
 Yet the mercenary friendship of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> prince had been purchased with costly and important gifts; the strong cities of <GPE>Martyropolis</GPE> and <PERSON>Dara</PERSON> were restored, and the <NORP>Persarmenians</NORP> became the willing subjects of an empire, whose eastern limit was extended, beyond the example of former times, as far as the banks of the Araxes, and the neighbourhood of the Caspian.
 A pious hope was indulged, that the church as well as the state might triumph in this revolution: but if <PERSON>Chosroes</PERSON> had sincerely listened to the <NORP>Christian</NORP> bishops, the impression was erased by the zeal and eloquence of the Magi: if he was armed with philosophic indifference, he accommodated his belief, or rather his professions, to the various circumstances of an exile and a sovereign.
 The imaginary conversion of the king of <GPE>Persia</GPE> was reduced to a local and superstitious veneration for Sergius, (19) <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the saints of Antioch, who heard his prayers and appeared to him in dreams; he enriched the shrine with offerings of gold and silver, and ascribed to this invisible patron the success of his arms, and the pregnancy of Sira, a devout <NORP>Christian</NORP> and the best beloved of his wives.
 (20) The beauty of Sira, or Schirin, (21) her wit, her musical talents, are still famous in the history, or rather in the romances, of the East: her own name is expressive, in the <NORP>Persian</NORP> tongue, of sweetness and grace; and the epithet of <PERSON>Parviz</PERSON> alludes to the charms of her royal lover.
 Yet <PERSON>Sira</PERSON> never shared the passions which she inspired, and the bliss of <PERSON>Chosroes</PERSON> was tortured by a jealous doubt, that while he possessed her person, she had bestowed her affections on a meaner favorite.

 By the departure of the Lombards, and the ruin of the Gepidae, the balance of power was destroyed on the Danube; and the <PERSON>Avars</PERSON> spread their permanent dominion from the foot of the <LOC>Alps</LOC> to the sea-coast of the Euxine.
 The reign of <PERSON>Baian</PERSON> is the brightest aera of their monarchy; their chagan, who occupied the rustic palace of Attila, appears to have imitated his character and policy; (23) but as the same scenes were repeated in a smaller circle, a minute representation of the copy would be devoid of the greatness and novelty of the original.
 The pride of the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> Justin, of Tiberius, and Maurice, was humbled by a proud Barbarian, more prompt to inflict, than exposed to suffer, the injuries of war; and as often as <LOC>Asia</LOC> was threatened by the <NORP>Persian</NORP> arms, <LOC>Europe</LOC> was oppressed by the dangerous inroads, or costly friendship, of the Avars.
 When the <NORP>Roman</NORP> envoys approached the presence of the chagan, they were commanded to wait at the door of his tent, till, at the end perhaps of ten or <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> days, he condescended to admit them.
 If the substance or the style of their message was offensive to his ear, he insulted, with real or affected fury, their own dignity, and that of their prince; their baggage was plundered, and their lives were only saved by the promise of a richer present and a more respectful address.
 But his sacred ambassadors enjoyed and abused an unbounded license in the midst of Constantinople: they urged, with importunate clamors, the increase of tribute, or the restitution of captives and deserters: and the majesty of the empire was almost equally degraded by a base compliance, or by the false and fearful excuses with which they eluded such insolent demands.
 The chagan had never seen an elephant; and his curiosity was excited by the strange, and perhaps fabulous, portrait of that wonderful animal.
 At his command, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the largest elephants of the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> stables was equipped with stately caparisons, and conducted by a numerous train to the royal village in the plains of Hungary.
 He surveyed the enormous beast with surprise, with disgust, and possibly with terror; and smiled at the vain industry of the Romans, who, in search of such useless rarities, could explore the limits of the land and sea.
 He wished, at the expense of the emperor, to repose in a golden bed.
 The wealth of Constantinople, and the skilful diligence of her artists, were instantly devoted to the gratification of his caprice; but when the work was finished, he rejected with scorn a present so unworthy the majesty of a great king.
 (24) These were the casual sallies of his pride; but the avarice of the chagan was a more steady and tractable passion: a rich and regular supply of silk apparel, furniture, and plate, introduced the rudiments of art and luxury among the tents of the Scythians; their appetite was stimulated by the pepper and cinnamon of India; (25) the <DATE>annual</DATE> subsidy or tribute was raised from fourscore to <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and twenty <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pieces of gold; and after each hostile interruption, the payment of the arrears, with exorbitant interest, was always made the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> condition of the new treaty.
 In the language of a Barbarian, without guile, the prince of the <PERSON>Avars</PERSON> affected to complain of the insincerity of the Greeks; (26) yet he was not inferior to the most civilized nations in the refinement of dissimulation and perfidy.
 As the successor of the Lombards, the chagan asserted his claim to the important city of Sirmium, the ancient bulwark of the <NORP>Illyrian</NORP> provinces.
 (27) The plains of the Lower <GPE>Hungary</GPE> were covered with the <PRODUCT>Avar</PRODUCT> horse and a fleet of large boats was built in the <GPE>Hercynian</GPE> wood, to descend the Danube, and to transport into the Save the materials of a bridge.
 But as the strong garrison of Singidunum, which commanded the conflux of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> rivers, might have stopped their passage and baffled his designs, he dispelled their apprehensions by a solemn oath that his views were not hostile to the empire.
 He swore by his sword, the symbol of the god of war, that he did not, as the enemy of Rome, construct a bridge upon the Save.
 After this barbarous imprecation, he calmly inquired, what oath was most sacred and venerable among the Christians, what guilt or perjury it was most dangerous to incur.
 The bishop of <GPE>Singidunum</GPE> presented the gospel, which the chagan received with devout reverence.
 As soon as he rose from his knees, he accelerated the labor of the bridge, and despatched an envoy to proclaim what he no longer wished to conceal.
 Without the hope of relief, the defence of <LOC>Sirmium</LOC> was prolonged above <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> years: the walls were still untouched; but famine was enclosed within the walls, till a merciful capitulation allowed the escape of the naked and hungry inhabitants.
 Singidunum, at the distance of fifty miles, experienced a more cruel fate: the buildings were razed, and the vanquished people was condemned to servitude and exile.
 Yet the ruins of <LOC>Sirmium</LOC> are no longer visible; the advantageous situation of <GPE>Singidunum</GPE> soon attracted a new colony of Sclavonians, and the conflux of the Save and <LOC>Danube</LOC> is still guarded by the fortifications of Belgrade, or the White City, so often and so obstinately disputed by the <NORP>Christian</NORP> and <NORP>Turkish</NORP> arms.
 (28) From <GPE>Belgrade</GPE> to the walls of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> a line may be measured of <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> miles: that line was marked with flames and with blood; the horses of the <PERSON>Avars</PERSON> were alternately bathed in the <PRODUCT>Euxine</PRODUCT> and the Adriatic; and the <NORP>Roman</NORP> pontiff, alarmed by the approach of a more savage enemy, (29) was reduced to cherish the Lombards, as the protectors of Italy.
 The despair of a captive, whom his country refused to ransom, disclosed to the <PERSON>Avars</PERSON> the invention and practice of military engines.
 (30) But in the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> attempts they were rudely framed, and awkwardly managed; and the resistance of <NORP>Diocletianopolis</NORP> and Beraea, of <GPE>Philippopolis</GPE> and Adrianople, soon exhausted the skill and patience of the besiegers.
 The warfare of <PERSON>Baian</PERSON> was that of a Tartar; yet his mind was susceptible of a humane and generous sentiment: he spared Anchialus, whose salutary waters had restored the health of the best beloved of his wives; and the <NORP>Romans</NORP> confessed, that their starving army was fed and dismissed by the liberality of a foe.
 His empire extended over Hungary, Poland, and Prussia, from the mouth of the <LOC>Danube</LOC> to that of the Oder; (31) and his new subjects were divided and transplanted by the jealous policy of the conqueror.
 (32) The eastern regions of Germany, which had been left vacant by the emigration of the Vandals, were replenished with <NORP>Sclavonian</NORP> colonists; the same tribes are discovered in the neighbourhood of the <LOC>Adriatic</LOC> and of the Baltic, and with the name of <PERSON>Baian</PERSON> himself, the <NORP>Illyrian</NORP> cities of <GPE>Neyss</GPE> and <GPE>Lissa</GPE> are again found in the heart of Silesia.
 In the disposition both of his troops and provinces the chagan exposed the vassals, whose lives he disregarded, (33) to the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> assault; and the swords of the enemy were blunted before they encountered the native valour of the Avars.
 Wars of <PERSON>Maurice</PERSON> against the Avars, A.
D.
 595-602.
.
 The <NORP>Persian</NORP> alliance restored the troops of the <LOC>East</LOC> to the defence of Europe: and Maurice, who had supported ten years the insolence of the chagan, declared his resolution to march in person against the Barbarians.
 In the space of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> centuries, none of the successors of <GPE>Theodosius</GPE> had appeared in the field: their lives were supinely spent in the palace of Constantinople; and the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> could no longer understand, that the name of emperor, in its primitive sense, denoted the chief of the armies of the republic.
 The martial ardor of <PERSON>Maurice</PERSON> was opposed by the grave flattery of the senate, the timid superstition of the patriarch, and the tears of the empress Constantina; and they all conjured him to devolve on some meaner general the fatigues and perils of a <NORP>Scythian</NORP> campaign.
 Deaf to their advice and entreaty, the emperor boldly advanced (34) <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> miles from the capital; the sacred ensign of the cross was displayed in the front; and <PERSON>Maurice</PERSON> reviewed, with conscious pride, the arms and numbers of the veterans who had fought and conquered beyond the Tigris.
 <PERSON>Anchialus</PERSON> was the last term of his progress by sea and land; he solicited, without success, a miraculous answer to his nocturnal prayers; his mind was confounded by the death of a favorite horse, the encounter of a wild boar, a storm of wind and rain, and the birth of a monstrous child; and he forgot that the best of omens is to unsheathe our sword in the defence of our country.
 (35) Under the pretence of receiving the ambassadors of Persia, the emperor returned to Constantinople, exchanged the thoughts of war for those of devotion, and disappointed the public hope by his absence and the choice of his lieutenants.
 The blind partiality of fraternal love might excuse the promotion of his brother Peter, who fled with equal disgrace from the Barbarians, from his own soldiers and from the inhabitants of a <NORP>Roman</NORP> city.
 That city, if we may credit the resemblance of name and character, was the famous Azimuntium, (36) which had alone repelled the tempest of Attila.
 The example of her warlike youth was propagated to succeeding generations; and they obtained, from the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> or the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> Justin, an honourable privilege, that their valour should be always reserved for the defence of their native country.
 The brother of <PERSON>Maurice</PERSON> attempted to violate this privilege, and to mingle a patriot band with the mercenaries of his camp; they retired to the church, he was not awed by the sanctity of the place; the people rose in their cause, the gates were shut, the ramparts were manned; and the cowardice of <PERSON>Peter</PERSON> was found equal to his arrogance and injustice.
 The military fame of <PERSON>Commentiolus</PERSON> (37) is the object of satire or comedy rather than of serious history, since he was even deficient in the vile and vulgar qualification of personal courage.
 His solemn councils, strange evolutions, and secret orders, always supplied an apology for flight or delay.
 If he marched against the enemy, the pleasant valleys of Mount Haemus opposed an insuperable barrier; but in his retreat, he explored, with fearless curiosity, the most difficult and obsolete paths, which had almost escaped the memory of the oldest native.
 The only blood which he lost was drawn, in a real or affected malady, by the lancet of a surgeon; and his health, which felt with exquisite sensibility the approach of the Barbarians, was uniformly restored by the repose and safety of the <DATE>winter</DATE> season.
 A prince who could promote and support this unworthy favorite must derive no glory from the accidental merit of his colleague Priscus.
 (38) In <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> successive battles, which seem to have been conducted with skill and resolution, seventeen <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> were made prisoners: near sixty thousand, with <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> sons of the chagan, were slain: the <NORP>Roman</NORP> general surprised a peaceful district of the Gepidae, who slept under the protection of the Avars; and his last trophies were erected on the banks of the <LOC>Danube</LOC> and the Teyss.
 Since the death of <PERSON>Trajan</PERSON> the arms of the empire had not penetrated so deeply into the old Dacia: yet the success of <PERSON>Priscus</PERSON> was transient and barren; and he was soon recalled by the apprehension that Baian, with dauntless spirit and recruited forces, was preparing to avenge his defeat under the walls of Constantinople.
 (39) State of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> armies.
 The theory of war was not more familiar to the camps of <PERSON>Caesar</PERSON> and Trajan, than to those of <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> and Maurice.
 (40)The iron of <GPE>Tuscany</GPE> or <LOC>Pontus</LOC> still received the keenest temper from the skill of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> workmen.
 The magazines were plentifully stored with every species of offensive and defensive arms.
 In the construction and use of ships, engines, and fortifications, the <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> admired the superior ingenuity of a people whom they had so often vanquished in the field.
 The science of tactics, the order, evolutions, and stratagems of antiquity, was transcribed and studied in the books of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and Romans.
 But the solitude or degeneracy of the provinces could no longer supply a race of men to handle those weapons, to guard those walls, to navigate those ships, and to reduce the theory of war into bold and successful practice.
 The genius of <PERSON>Belisarius</PERSON> and <PERSON>Narses</PERSON> had been formed without a master, and expired without a disciple.
 Neither honour, nor patriotism, nor generous superstition, could animate the lifeless bodies of slaves and strangers, who had succeeded to the honours of the legions: it was in the camp alone that the emperor should have exercised a despotic command; it was only in the camps that his authority was disobeyed and insulted: he appeased and inflamed with gold the licentiousness of the troops; but their vices were inherent, their victories were accidental, and their costly maintenance exhausted the substance of a state which they were unable to defend.
 After a long and pernicious indulgence, the cure of this inveterate evil was undertaken by Maurice; but the rash attempt, which drew destruction on his own head, tended only to aggravate the disease.
 A reformer should be exempt from the suspicion of interest, and he must possess the confidence and esteem of those whom he proposes to reclaim.
 The troops of <PERSON>Maurice</PERSON> might listen to the voice of a victorious leader; they disdained the admonitions of statesmen and sophists; and, when they received an edict which deducted from their pay the price of their arms and clothing,their discontent, they execrated the avarice of a prince insensible of the dangers and fatigues from which he had escaped.
 The camps both of <LOC>Asia</LOC> and <LOC>Europe</LOC> were agitated with frequent and furious seditions; (41) the enraged soldiers of <GPE>Edessa</GPE> pursued with reproaches, with threats, with wounds, their trembling generals; they overturned the statues of the emperor, cast stones against the miraculous image of Christ, and either rejected the yoke of all civil and military laws, or instituted a dangerous model of voluntary subordination.
 The monarch, always distant and often deceived, was incapable of yielding or persisting, according to the exigence of the moment.
 But the fear of a general revolt induced him too readily to accept any act of valour, or any expression of loyalty, as an atonement for the popular offence; the new reform was abolished as hastily as it had been announced, and the troops, instead of punishment and restraint, were agreeably surprised by a gracious proclamation of immunities and rewards.
 But the soldiers accepted without gratitude the tardy and reluctant gifts of the emperor: their insolence was elated by the discovery of his weakness and their own strength; and their mutual hatred was inflamed beyond the desire of forgiveness or the hope of reconciliation.
 The historians of the times adopt the vulgar suspicion, that <PERSON>Maurice</PERSON> conspired to destroy the troops whom he had labored to reform; the misconduct and favour of <PERSON>Commentiolus</PERSON> are imputed to this malevolent design; and every age must condemn the inhumanity of avarice (42) of a prince, who, by the trifling ransom of <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pieces of gold, might have prevented the massacre of <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> prisoners in the hands of the chagan.
 and rebellion.
 In the just fervour of indignation, an order was signified to the army of the Danube, that they should spare the magazines of the province, and establish their <DATE>winter</DATE> quarters in the hostile country of the Avars.
 The measure of their grievances was full: they pronounced <PERSON>Maurice</PERSON> unworthy to reign, expelled or slaughtered his faithful adherents, and, under the command of Phocas, a simple centurion, returned by hasty marches to the neighbourhood of Constantinople.
 Election of Phocas, A.
D.
 602, October.
 After a long series of legal succession, the military disorders of the <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> century were again revived; yet such was the novelty of the enterprise, that the insurgents were awed by their own rashness.
 They hesitated to invest their favourite with the vacant purple; and, while they rejected all treaty with <PERSON>Maurice</PERSON> himself, they held a friendly correspondence with his son Theodosius, and with Germanus, the father-in-law of the royal youth.
 So obscure had been the former condition of Phocas, that the emperor was ignorant of the name and character of his rival; but as soon as he learned, that the centurion, though bold in sedition, was timid in the face of danger, "Alas!" cried the desponding prince, "if he is a coward, he will surely be a murderer.
" Revolt of Constantinople.
 Yet if <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> had been firm and faithful, the murderer might have spent his fury against the walls; and the rebel army would have been gradually consumed or reconciled by the prudence of the emperor.
 In the games of the Circus, which he repeated with unusual pomp, <PERSON>Maurice</PERSON> disguised, with smiles of confidence, the anxiety of his heart, condescended to solicit the applause of the factions, and flattered their pride by accepting from their respective tribunes a list of <CARDINAL>nine</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> blues and fifteen <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> greens, whom he affected to esteem as the solid pillars of his throne Their treacherous or languid support betrayed his weakness and hastened his fall: the green faction were the secret accomplices of the rebels, and the blues recommended lenity and moderation in a contest with their <NORP>Roman</NORP> brethren The rigid and parsimonious virtues of <PERSON>Maurice</PERSON> had long since alienated the hearts of his subjects: as he walked barefoot in a religious procession, he was rudely assaulted with stones, and his guards were compelled to present their iron maces in the defence of his person.
 A fanatic monk ran through the streets with a drawn sword, denouncing against him the wrath and the sentence of God; and a vile plebeian, who represented his countenance and apparel, was seated on an ass, and pursued by the imprecations of the multitude.
 (43) The emperor suspected the popularity of <PERSON>Germanus</PERSON> with the soldiers and citizens: he feared, he threatened, but he delayed to strike; the patrician fled to the sanctuary of the church; the people rose in his defence, the walls were deserted by the guards, and the lawless city was abandoned to the flames and rapine of a nocturnal tumult.
 In a small bark, the unfortunate Maurice, with his wife and <CARDINAL>nine</CARDINAL> children, escaped to the <NORP>Asiatic</NORP> shore; but the violence of the wind compelled him to land at the church of St.
 Autonomus, (44) near Chalcedon, from whence he despatched Theodosius, he eldest son, to implore the gratitude and friendship of the <NORP>Persian</NORP> monarch.
 For himself, he refused to fly: his body was tortured with sciatic pains, (45) his mind was enfeebled by superstition; he patiently awaited the event of the revolution, and addressed a fervent and public prayer to the Almighty, that the punishment of his sins might be inflicted in this world rather than in a future life.
 After the abdication of Maurice, the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> factions disputed the choice of an emperor; but the favourite of the blues was rejected by the jealousy of their antagonists, and <PERSON>Germanus</PERSON> himself was hurried along by the crowds who rushed to the palace of Hebdomon, <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> miles from the city, to adore the majesty of <PERSON>Phocas</PERSON> the centurion.
 A modest wish of resigning the purple to the rank and merit of <PERSON>Germanus</PERSON> was opposed by his resolution, more obstinate and equally sincere; the senate and clergy obeyed his summons; and, as soon as the patriarch was assured of his orthodox belief, he consecrated the successful usurper in the church of St.
 John the Baptist.
 On the <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> day, amidst the acclamations of a thoughtless people, <PERSON>Phocas</PERSON> made his public entry in a chariot drawn by <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> white horses: the revolt of the troops was rewarded by a lavish donative; and the new sovereign, after visiting the palace, beheld from his throne the games of the hippodrome.
 In a dispute of precedency between the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> factions, his partial judgment inclined in favour of the greens.
 "Remember that <PERSON>Maurice</PERSON> is still alive," resounded from the opposite side; and the indiscreet clamour of the blues admonished and stimulated the cruelty of the tyrant.
Death of <PERSON>Maurice</PERSON> and his children, A.
D.
 602, Nov.
 27.
 The ministers of death were despatched to Chalcedon: they dragged the emperor from his sanctuary; and the <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> sons of <PERSON>Maurice</PERSON> were successively murdered before the eyes of their agonizing parent.
 At each stroke, which he felt in his heart, he found strength to rehearse a pious ejaculation: "Thou art just, O Lord! and thy judgments are righteous.
" And such, in the last moments, was his rigid attachment to truth and justice, that he revealed to the soldiers the pious falsehood of a nurse who presented her own child in the place of a royal infant.
 (46) The tragic scene was finally closed by the execution of the emperor himself, in the twentieth year of his reign, and the <CARDINAL>sixty-third</CARDINAL> of his age.
 The bodies of the father and his <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> sons were cast into the sea; their heads were exposed at <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> to the insults or pity of the multitude; and it was not till some signs of putrefaction had appeared, that <PERSON>Phocas</PERSON> connived at the private burial of these venerable remains.
 In that grave, the faults and errors of <PERSON>Maurice</PERSON> were kindly interred.
 His fate alone was remembered; and at the end of twenty years, in the recital of the history of Theophylact, the mournful tale was interrupted by the tears of the audience.

.
 Such tears must have flowed in secret, and such compassion would have been criminal, under the reign of Phocas, who was peaceably acknowledged in the provinces of the <LOC>East</LOC> and West.
 The images of the emperor and his wife <PERSON>Leontia</PERSON> were exposed in the <NORP>Lateran</NORP> to the veneration of the clergy and senate of Rome, and afterwards deposited in the palace of the Caesars, between those of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> and Theodosius.
 As a subject and a Christian, it was the duty of <PERSON>Gregory</PERSON> to acquiesce in the established government; but the joyful applause with which he salutes the fortune of the assassin, has sullied, with indelible disgrace, the character of the saint.
 The successor of the apostles might have inculcated with decent firmness the guilt of blood, and the necessity of repentance; he is content to celebrate the deliverance of the people and the fall of the oppressor; to rejoice that the piety and benignity of <PERSON>Phocas</PERSON> have been raised by <GPE>Providence</GPE> to the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> throne; to pray that his hands may be strengthened against all his enemies; and to express a wish, perhaps a prophecy, that, after a long and triumphant reign, he may be transferred from a temporal to an everlasting kingdom.
 (48) I have already traced the steps of a revolution so pleasing, in Gregory's opinion, both to heaven and earth; His character, and <PERSON>Phocas</PERSON> does not appear less hateful in the exercise than in the acquisition of power.
 The pencil of an impartial historian has delineated the portrait of a monster: (49) his diminutive and deformed person, the closeness of his shaggy eyebrows, his red hair, his beardless chin, and his cheek disfigured and discoloured by a formidable scar.
 Ignorant of letters, of laws, and even of arms, he indulged in the supreme rank a more ample privilege of lust and drunkenness; and his brutal pleasures were either injurious to his subjects or disgraceful to himself.
 Without assuming the office of a prince, he renounced the profession of a soldier; and the reign of <PERSON>Phocas</PERSON> afflicted <LOC>Europe</LOC> with ignominious peace, and <LOC>Asia</LOC> with desolating war.
 His savage temper was inflamed by passion, hardened by fear, and exasperated by resistance of reproach.
 The flight of <GPE>Theodosius</GPE> to the <NORP>Persian</NORP> court had been intercepted by a rapid pursuit, or a deceitful message: he was beheaded at Nice, and the last hours of the young prince were soothed by the comforts of religion and the consciousness of innocence.
 Yet his phantom disturbed the repose of the usurper: a whisper was circulated through the East, that the son of <PERSON>Maurice</PERSON> was still alive: the people expected their avenger, and the widow and daughters of the late emperor would have adopted as their son and brother the vilest of mankind.
 In the massacre of the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> family, (50) the mercy, or rather the discretion, of <PERSON>Phocas</PERSON> had spared these unhappy females, and they were decently confined to a private house.
 But the spirit of the empress Constantina, still mindful of her father, her husband, and her sons, aspired to freedom and revenge.
 At the dead of night, she escaped to the sanctuary of St.
 Sophia; but her tears, and the gold of her associate Germanus, were insufficient to provoke an insurrection.
 Her life was forfeited to revenge, and even to justice: but the patriarch obtained and pledged an oath for her safety: a monastery was allotted for her prison, and the widow of <PERSON>Maurice</PERSON> accepted and abused the lenity of his assassin.
 The discovery or the suspicion of a <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> conspiracy, dissolved the engagements, and rekindled the fury, of Phocas.
 and tyranny.
 A matron who commanded the respect and pity of mankind, the daughter, wife, and mother of emperors, was tortured like the vilest malefactor, to force a confession of her designs and associates; and the empress Constantina, with her <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> innocent daughters, was beheaded at Chalcedon, on the same ground which had been stained with the blood of her husband and <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> sons.
 After such an example, it would be superfluous to enumerate the names and sufferings of meaner victims.
 Their condemnation was seldom preceded by the forms of trial, and their punishment was embittered by the refinements of cruelty: their eyes were pierced, their tongues were torn from the root, the hands and feet were amputated; some expired under the lash, others in the flames; others again were transfixed with arrows; and a simple speedy death was mercy which they could rarely obtain.
 The hippodrome, the sacred asylum of the pleasures and the liberty of the Romans, was polluted with heads and limbs, and mangled bodies; and the companions of <PERSON>Phocas</PERSON> were the most sensible, that neither his favour, nor their services, could protect them from a tyrant, the worthy rival of the <NORP>Caligulas</NORP> and <NORP>Domitians</NORP> of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> age of the empire.
 (51) His fall and death, A.
D.
 610, <DATE>October</DATE> 4.
 A daughter of Phocas, his only child, was given in marriage to the patrician Crispus, (52) and the royal images of the bride and bridegroom were indiscreetly placed in the circus, by the side of the emperor.
 The father must desire that his posterity should inherit the fruit of his crimes, but the monarch was offended by this premature and popular association: the tribunes of the green faction, who accused the officious error of their sculptors, were condemned to instant death: their lives were granted to the prayers of the people; but <PERSON>Crispus</PERSON> might reasonably doubt, whether a jealous usurper could forget and pardon his involuntary competition.
 The green faction was alienated by the ingratitude of <PERSON>Phocas</PERSON> and the loss of their privileges; every province of the empire was ripe for rebellion; and Heraclius, exarch of Africa, persisted above <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> years in refusing all tribute and obedience to the centurion who disgraced the throne of Constantinople.
 By the secret emissaries of <PERSON>Crispus</PERSON> and the senate, the independent exarch was solicited to save and to govern his country; but his ambition was chilled by age, and he resigned the dangerous enterprise to his son Heraclius, and to Nicetas, the son of Gregory, his friend and lieutenant.
 The powers of <LOC>Africa</LOC> were armed by the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> adventurous youths; they agreed that the <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> should navigate the fleet from <GPE>Carthage</GPE> to Constantinople, that the other should lead an army through <GPE>Egypt</GPE> and Asia, and that the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> purple should be the reward of diligence and success.
 A faint rumour of their undertaking was conveyed to the ears of Phocas, and the wife and mother of the younger <PERSON>Heraclius</PERSON> were secured as the hostages of his faith: but the treacherous heart of <PERSON>Crispus</PERSON> extenuated the distant peril, the means of defence were neglected or delayed, and the tyrant supinely slept till the <NORP>African</NORP> navy cast anchor in the Hellespont.
 Their standard was joined at <PERSON>Abidus</PERSON> by the fugitives and exiles who thirsted for revenge; the ships of Heraclius, whose lofty masts were adorned with the holy symbols of religion, (53) steered their triumphant course through the Propontis; and <PERSON>Phocas</PERSON> beheld from the windows of the palace his approaching and inevitable fate.
 The green faction was tempted, by gifts and promises, to oppose a feeble and fruitless resistance to the landing of the Africans: but the people, and even the guards, were determined by the well-timed defection of Crispus; and they tyrant was seized by a private enemy, who boldly invaded the solitude of the palace.
 Stripped of the diadem and purple, clothed in a vile habit, and loaded with chains, he was transported in a small boat to the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> galley of Heraclius, who reproached him with the crimes of his abominable reign.
 "Wilt thou govern better?" were the last words of the despair of Phocas.
 After suffering each variety of insult and torture, his head was severed from his body, the mangled trunk was cast into the flames, and the same treatment was inflicted on the statues of the vain usurper, and the seditious banner of the green faction.
 The voice of the clergy, the senate, and the people, invited <PERSON>Heraclius</PERSON> to ascend the throne which he had purified from guilt and ignominy; after some graceful hesitation, he yielded to their entreaties.
Reign of Heraclius, A.

 642, February 11.
 His coronation was accompanied by that of his wife Eudoxia; and their posterity, till the <ORDINAL>fourth</ORDINAL> generation, continued to reign over the empire of the East.
 The voyage of <PERSON>Heraclius</PERSON> had been easy and prosperous; the tedious march of <PERSON>Nicetas</PERSON> was not accomplished before the decision of the contest: but he submitted without a murmur to the fortune of his friend, and his laudable intentions were rewarded with an equestrian statue, and a daughter of the emperor.
 It was more difficult to trust the fidelity of Crispus, whose recent services were recompensed by the command of the <NORP>Cappadocian</NORP> army.
 His arrogance soon provoked, and seemed to excuse, the ingratitude of his new sovereign.
 In the presence of the senate, the son-in-law of <PERSON>Phocas</PERSON> was condemned to embrace the monastic life; and the sentence was justified by the weighty observation of Heraclius, that the man who had betrayed his father could never be faithful to his friend.

 According to the friendly and equal forms of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> and <NORP>Persian</NORP> courts, he announced his exaltation to the throne; and his ambassador Lilius, who had presented him with the heads of <PERSON>Maurice</PERSON> and his sons, was the best qualified to describe the circumstances of the tragic scene.
 (55) However it might be varnished by fiction or sophistry, <PERSON>Chosroes</PERSON> turned with horror from the assassin, imprisoned the pretended envoy, disclaimed the usurper, and declared himself the avenger of his father and benefactor.
 The sentiments of grief and resentment, which humanity would feel, and honour would dictate, promoted on this occasion the interest of the <NORP>Persian</NORP> king; and his interest was powerfully magnified by the national and religious prejudices of the <PERSON>Magi</PERSON> and satraps.
 In a strain of artful adulation, which assumed the language of freedom, they presumed to censure the excess of his gratitude and friendship for the Greeks; a nation with whom it was dangerous to conclude either peace or alliance; whose superstition was devoid of truth and justice, and who must be incapable of any virtue, since they could perpetrate the most atrocious of crimes, the impious murder of their sovereign.
 (56) For the crime of an ambitious centurion, the nation which he oppressed was chastised with the calamities of war; and the same calamities, at the end of twenty years, were retaliated and redoubled on the heads of the Persians.
 (57) The general who had restored <PERSON>Chosroes</PERSON> to the throne still commanded in the East; and the name of <PERSON>Narses</PERSON> was the formidable sound with which the <NORP>Assyrian</NORP> mothers were accustomed to terrify their infants.
 It is not improbable, that a native subject of <GPE>Persia</GPE> should encourage his master and his friend to deliver and possess the provinces of Asia.
 It is still more probable, that <PERSON>Chosroes</PERSON> should animate his troops by the assurance that the sword which they dreaded the most would remain in its scabbard, or be drawn in their favour.
 The hero could not depend on the faith of a tyrant; and the tyrant was conscious how little he deserved the obedience of a hero.
 <PERSON>Narses</PERSON> was removed from his military command; he reared an independent standard at Hierapolis, in Syria: he was betrayed by fallacious promises, and burnt alive in the market-place of Constantinople.
 Deprived of the only chief whom they could fear or esteem, the bands which he had led to victory were twice broken by the cavalry, trampled by the elephants, and pierced by the arrows of the Barbarians; and a great number of the captives were beheaded on the field of battle by the sentence of the victor, who might justly condemn these seditious mercenaries as the authors or accomplices of the death of Maurice.
 Under the reign of Phocas, the fortifications of Merdin, Dara, Amida, and Edessa, were successively besieged, reduced, and destroyed, by the <NORP>Persian</NORP> monarch: His conquest of Syria, A.

 he passed the Euphrates, occupied the <NORP>Syrian</NORP> cities, Hierapolis, Chalcis, and <LOC>Berrhaea</LOC> or Aleppo, and soon encompassed the walls of <GPE>Antioch</GPE> with his irresistible arms.
 The rapid tide of success discloses the decay of the empire, the incapacity of Phocas, and the disaffection of his subjects; and <PERSON>Chosroes</PERSON> provided a decent apology for their submission or revolt, by an impostor, who attended his camp as the son of <PERSON>Maurice</PERSON> (58) and the lawful heir of the monarchy.

.
 The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> intelligence from the <LOC>East</LOC> which <PERSON>Heraclius</PERSON> received, (59) was that of the loss of Antioch; but the aged metropolis, so often overturned by earthquakes, and pillaged by the enemy, could supply but a small and languid stream of treasure and blood.
 The <NORP>Persians</NORP> were equally successful, and more fortunate, in the sack of Caesarea, the capital of Cappadocia; and as they advanced beyond the ramparts of the frontier, the boundary of ancient war, they found a less obstinate resistance and a more plentiful harvest.
 The pleasant vale of <GPE>Damascus</GPE> has been adorned in every age with a royal city: her obscure felicity has hitherto escaped the historian of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire: but <PERSON>Chosroes</PERSON> reposed his troops in the paradise of <GPE>Damascus</GPE> before he ascended the hills of Libanus, or invaded the cities of the <NORP>Phoenician</NORP> coast.
 The conquest of Jerusalem, (60) which had been meditated by Nushirvan, was achieved by the zeal and avarice of his grandson; the ruin of the proudest monument of <NORP>Christianity</NORP> was vehemently urged by the intolerant spirit of the Magi; and he could enlist for this holy warfare with an army of six-and- twenty <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> Jews, whose furious bigotry might compensate, in some degree, for the want of valour and discipline.
 After the reduction of Galilee, and the region beyond the Jordan, whose resistance appears to have delayed the fate of the capital, <GPE>Jerusalem</GPE> itself was taken by assault.
 The sepulchre of Christ, and the stately churches of <GPE>Helena</GPE> and Constantine, were consumed, or at least damaged, by the flames; the devout offerings of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> years were rifled in <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> sacrilegious day; the Patriarch Zachariah, and the true cross, were transported into Persia; and the massacre of ninety <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> <NORP>Christians</NORP> is imputed to the <NORP>Jews</NORP> and Arabs, who swelled the disorder of the <NORP>Persian</NORP> march.
 The fugitives of <GPE>Palestine</GPE> were entertained at <GPE>Alexandria</GPE> by the charity of John the Archbishop, who is distinguished among a crowd of saints by the epithet of almsgiver: (61) and the revenues of the church, with a treasure of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pounds, were restored to the true proprietors, the poor of every country and every denomination.
 of Egypt, A.
D.
 616.
 But <GPE>Egypt</GPE> itself, the only province which had been exempt, since the time of Diocletian, from foreign and domestic war, was again subdued by the successors of Cyrus.
 Pelusium, the key of that impervious country, was surprised by the cavalry of the Persians: they passed, with impunity, the innumerable channels of the Delta, and explored the long valley of the Nile, from the pyramids of <GPE>Memphis</GPE> to the confines of Aethiopia.
 <GPE>Alexandria</GPE> might have been relieved by a naval force, but the archbishop and the praefect embarked for Cyprus; and <PERSON>Chosroes</PERSON> entered the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> city of the empire, which still preserved a wealthy remnant of industry and commerce.
 His western trophy was erected, not on the walls of Carthage, (62) but in the neighbourhood of Tripoli; the <NORP>Greek</NORP> colonies of <GPE>Cyrene</GPE> were finally extirpated; and the conqueror, treading in the footsteps of Alexander, returned in triumph through the sands of the <NORP>Libyan</NORP> desert.
 of <LOC>Asia</LOC> Minor, A.

 <CARDINAL>616</CARDINAL> etc.
 In the same campaign, another army advanced from the <LOC>Euphrates</LOC> to the Thracian Bosphorus; <GPE>Chalcedon</GPE> surrendered after a long siege, and a <NORP>Persian</NORP> camp was maintained above ten years in the presence of Constantinople.
 The sea-coast of Pontus, the city of Ancyra, and the Isle of Rhodes, are enumerated among the last conquests of the great king; and if <PERSON>Chosroes</PERSON> had possessed any maritime power, his boundless ambition would have spread slavery and desolation over the provinces of Europe.
 His reign and magnificence.
 From the long-disputed banks of the <LOC>Tigris</LOC> and Euphrates, the reign of the grandson of <PERSON>Nushirvan</PERSON> was suddenly extended to the <GPE>Hellespont</GPE> and the Nile, the ancient limits of the <NORP>Persian</NORP> monarchy.
 But the provinces, which had been fashioned by the habits of <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> years to the virtues and vices of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> government, supported with reluctance the yoke of the Barbarians.
 The idea of a republic was kept alive by the institutions, or at least by the writings, of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and Romans, and the subjects of <PERSON>Heraclius</PERSON> had been educated to pronounce the words of liberty and law.
 But it has always been the pride and policy of <NORP>Oriental</NORP> princes to display the titles and attributes of their omnipotence; to upbraid a nation of slaves with their true name and abject condition, and to enforce, by cruel and insolent threats, the rigour of their absolute commands.
 The <NORP>Christians</NORP> of the <LOC>East</LOC> were scandalized by the worship of fire, and the impious doctrine of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> principles: the <PERSON>Magi</PERSON> were not less intolerant than the bishops; and the martyrdom of some native Persians, who had deserted the religion of Zoroaster, (63) was conceived to be the prelude of a fierce and general persecution.
 By the oppressive laws of Justinian, the adversaries of the church were made the enemies of the state; the alliance of the Jews, Nestorians, and Jacobites, had contributed to the success of Chosroes, and his partial favour to the sectaries provoked the hatred and fears of the <NORP>Catholic</NORP> clergy.
 Conscious of their fear and hatred, the <NORP>Persian</NORP> conqueror governed his new subjects with an iron sceptre; and, as if he suspected the stability of his dominion, he exhausted their wealth by exorbitant tributes and licentious rapine despoiled or demolished the temples of the East; and transported to his hereditary realms the gold, the silver, the precious marbles, the arts, and the artists of the <NORP>Asiatic</NORP> cities.
 In the obscure picture of the calamities of the empire, (64) it is not easy to discern the figure of <PERSON>Chosroes</PERSON> himself, to separate his actions from those of his lieutenants, or to ascertain his personal merit in the general blaze of glory and magnificence.
 He enjoyed with ostentation the fruits of victory, and frequently retired from the hardships of war to the luxury of the palace.
 But in the space of twenty-four years, he was deterred by superstition or resentment from approaching the gates of Ctesiphon: and his favorite residence of Artemita, or Dastagerd, was situate beyond the Tigris, about sixty miles to the north of the capital.
 (65) The adjacent pastures were covered with flocks and herds: the paradise or park was replenished with pheasants, peacocks, ostriches, roebucks, and wild boars, and the noble game of lions and tigers was sometimes turned loose for the bolder pleasures of the chase.
 Nine <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and sixty elephants were maintained for the use or splendour of the great king: his tents and baggage were carried into the field by <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> great camels and eight <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> of a smaller size; (66) and the royal stables were filled with <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> mules and horses, among whom the names of <PERSON>Shebdiz</PERSON> and <PERSON>Barid</PERSON> are renowned for their speed or beauty.
 Six <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> guards successively mounted before the palace gate; the service of the interior apartments was performed by <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> slaves, and in the number of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> virgins, the fairest of Asia, some happy concubine might console her master for the age or the indifference of Sira.
 The various treasures of gold, silver, gems, silks, and aromatics, were deposited in a <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> subterraneous vaults and the chamber <PERSON>Badaverd</PERSON> denoted the accidental gift of the winds which had wafted the spoils of <PERSON>Heraclius</PERSON> into <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the <NORP>Syrian</NORP> harbours of his rival.
 The vice of flattery, and perhaps of fiction, is not ashamed to compute the <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> rich hangings that adorned the walls; the forty <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> columns of silver, or more probably of marble, and plated wood, that supported the roof; and the <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> globes of gold suspended in the dome, to imitate the motions of the planets and the constellations of the zodiac.
 (67) While the <NORP>Persian</NORP> monarch contemplated the wonders of his art and power, he received an epistle from an obscure citizen of Mecca, inviting him to acknowledge <PERSON>Mahomet</PERSON> as the apostle of God.
 He rejected the invitation, and tore the epistle.
 Placed on the verge of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> great empires of the East, <PERSON>Mahomet</PERSON> observed with secret joy the progress of their mutual destruction; and in the midst of the <NORP>Persian</NORP> triumphs, he ventured to foretell, that before many years should elapse, victory should again return to the banners of the Romans.
 (69) Distress of Heraclius, A.
D.
 610-622.
 At the time when this prediction is said to have been delivered, no prophecy could be more distant from its accomplishment, since the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> years of <PERSON>Heraclius</PERSON> announced the approaching dissolution of the empire.
 If the motives of <PERSON>Chosroes</PERSON> had been pure and honourable, he must have ended the quarrel with the death of Phocas, and he would have embraced, as his best ally, the fortunate <NORP>African</NORP> who had so generously avenged the injuries of his benefactor Maurice.
 The prosecution of the war revealed the true character of the Barbarian; and the suppliant embassies of <PERSON>Heraclius</PERSON> to beseech his clemency, that he would spare the innocent, accept a tribute, and give peace to the world, were rejected with contemptuous silence or insolent menace.
 Syria, Egypt, and the provinces of Asia, were subdued by the <NORP>Persian</NORP> arms, while Europe, from the confines of <LOC>Istria</LOC> to the long wall of Thrace, was oppressed by the Avars, unsatiated with the blood and rapine of the Italian war.
 They had coolly massacred their male captives in the sacred field of Pannonia; the women and children were reduced to servitude, and the noblest virgins were abandoned to the promiscuous lust of the Barbarians.
 The amorous matron who opened the gates of <GPE>Friuli</GPE> passed a short night in the arms of her royal lover; the next evening, <PERSON>Romilda</PERSON> was condemned to the embraces of <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> Avars, and the <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> day the <PERSON>Lombard</PERSON> princess was impaled in the sight of the camp, while the chagan observed with a cruel smile, that such a husband was the fit recompense of her lewdness and perfidy.
 (70) By these implacable enemies, Heraclius, on either side, was insulted and besieged: and the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire was reduced to the walls of Constantinople, with the remnant of Greece, Italy, and Africa, and some maritime cities, from <GPE>Tyre</GPE> to Trebizond, of the <NORP>Asiatic</NORP> coast.
 After the loss of Egypt, the capital was afflicted by famine and pestilence; and the emperor, incapable of resistance, and hopeless of relief, had resolved to transfer his person and government to the more secure residence of Carthage.
 His ships were already laden with the treasures of the palace; but his flight was arrested by the patriarch, who armed the powers of religion in the defence of his country; led <PERSON>Heraclius</PERSON> to the altar of St.
 Sophia, and extorted a solemn oath, that he would live and die with the people whom God had intrusted to his care.
 The chagan was encamped in the plains of Thrace; but he dissembled his perfidious designs, and solicited an interview with the emperor near the town of Heraclea.
 Their reconciliation was celebrated with equestrian games; the senate and people, in their gayest apparel, resorted to the festival of peace; and the <PERSON>Avars</PERSON> beheld, with envy and desire, the spectacle of <NORP>Roman</NORP> luxury.
 On a sudden the hippodrome was encompassed by the <NORP>Scythian</NORP> cavalry, who had pressed their secret and nocturnal march: the tremendous sound of the chagan's whip gave the signal of the assault, and Heraclius, wrapping his diadem round his arm, was saved with extreme hazard, by the fleetness of his horse.
 So rapid was the pursuit, that the <PERSON>Avars</PERSON> almost entered the golden gate of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> with the flying crowds: (71) but the plunder of the suburbs rewarded their treason, and they transported beyond the <LOC>Danube</LOC> <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and seventy <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> captives.
 On the shore of Chalcedon, the emperor held a safer conference with a more honourable foe, who, before <PERSON>Heraclius</PERSON> descended from his galley, saluted with reverence and pity the majesty of the purple.
 He solicits peace.
 The friendly offer of Sain, the <NORP>Persian</NORP> general, to conduct an embassy to the presence of the great king, was accepted with the warmest gratitude, and the prayer for pardon and peace was humbly presented by the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefect, the praefect of the city, and <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> ecclesiastics of the patriarchal church.
 (72) But the lieutenant of <PERSON>Chosroes</PERSON> had fatally mistaken the intentions of his master.
 <PERSON>Sain</PERSON> was flayed alive, according to the inhuman practice of his country; and the separate and rigorous confinement of the ambassadors violated the law of nations, and the faith of an express stipulation.
 Yet the experience of <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> years at length persuaded the <NORP>Persian</NORP> monarch to renounce the conquest of Constantinople, and to specify the <DATE>annual</DATE> tribute or ransom of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire; a <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> talents of gold, a <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> talents of silver, a <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> silk robes, a <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> horses, and a <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> virgins.
 <PERSON>Heraclius</PERSON> subscribed these ignominious terms; but the time and space which he obtained to collect such treasures from the poverty of the East, was industriously employed in the preparations of a bold and desperate attack.
 His preparations for war, A.
D.
 621.
 Of the characters conspicuous in history, that of <PERSON>Heraclius</PERSON> is <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the most extraordinary and inconsistent.
 In the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> and last years of a long reign, the emperor appears to be the slave of sloth, of pleasure, or of superstition, the careless and impotent spectator of the public calamities.
 But the languid mists of the morning and <TIME>evening</TIME> are separated by the brightness of the meridian sun; the <LOC>Arcadius</LOC> of the palace arose the <PERSON>Caesar</PERSON> of the camp; and the honour of <GPE>Rome</GPE> and <PERSON>Heraclius</PERSON> was gloriously retrieved by the exploits and trophies of <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> adventurous campaigns.
 It was the duty of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> historians to have revealed the causes of his slumber and vigilance.
 At this distance we can only conjecture, that he was endowed with more personal courage than political resolution; that he was detained by the charms, and perhaps the arts, of his niece Martina, with whom, after the death of Eudocia, he contracted an incestuous marriage; (73) and that he yielded to the base advice of the counsellors, who urged, as a fundamental law, that the life of the emperor should never be exposed in the field.
 (74) Perhaps he was awakened by the last insolent demand of the <NORP>Persian</NORP> conqueror; but at the moment when <PERSON>Heraclius</PERSON> assumed the spirit of a hero, the only hopes of the <NORP>Romans</NORP> were drawn from the vicissitudes of fortune, which might threaten the proud prosperity of Chosroes, and must be favourable to those who had attained the lowest period of depression.
 (75) To provide for the expenses of war, was the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> care of the emperor; and for the purpose of collecting the tribute, he was allowed to solicit the benevolence of the eastern provinces.
 But the revenue no longer flowed in the usual channels; the credit of an arbitrary prince is annihilated by his power; and the courage of <PERSON>Heraclius</PERSON> was <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> displayed in daring to borrow the consecrated wealth of churches, under the solemn vow of restoring, with usury, whatever he had been compelled to employ in the service of religion and the empire.
 The clergy themselves appear to have sympathized with the public distress; and the discreet patriarch of Alexandria, without admitting the precedent of sacrilege, assisted his sovereign by the miraculous or seasonable revelation of a secret treasure.
 (76) Of the soldiers who had conspired with Phocas, only <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> were found to have survived the stroke of time and of the Barbarians; (77) the loss, even of these seditious veterans, was imperfectly supplied by the new levies of Heraclius, and the gold of the sanctuary united, in the same camp, the names, and arms, and languages of the <LOC>East</LOC> and West.
 He would have been content with the neutrality of the Avars; and his friendly entreaty, that the chagan would act, not as the enemy, but as the guardian, of the empire, was accompanied with a more persuasive donative of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pieces of gold.
 Two days after the festival of Easter, the emperor, exchanging his purple for the simple garb of a penitent and warrior, (78) gave the signal of his departure.
 To the faith of the people <PERSON>Heraclius</PERSON> recommended his children; the civil and military powers were vested in the most deserving hands, and the discretion of the patriarch and senate was authorized to save or surrender the city, if they should be oppressed in his absence by the superior forces of the enemy.
 <ORDINAL>First</ORDINAL> expedition of <PERSON>Heraclius</PERSON> against the Persians, A.
D.
 622.
 The neighbouring heights of <GPE>Chalcedon</GPE> were covered with tents and arms: but if the new levies of <PERSON>Heraclius</PERSON> had been rashly led to the attack, the victory of the <NORP>Persians</NORP> in the sight of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> might have been the last day of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
 As imprudent would it have been to advance into the provinces of Asia, leaving their innumerable cavalry to intercept his convoys, and continually to hang on the lassitude and disorder of his rear.
 But the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> were still masters of the sea; a fleet of galleys, transports, and store-ships, was assembled in the harbour; the <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> consented to embark; a steady wind carried them through the <GPE>Hellespont</GPE> the western and southern coast of <LOC>Asia</LOC> Minor lay on their left hand; the spirit of their chief was <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> displayed in a storm, and even the eunuchs of his train were excited to suffer and to work by the example of their master.
 He landed his troops on the confines of <GPE>Syria</GPE> and Cilicia, in the Gulf of Scanderoon, where the coast suddenly turns to the south; (79) and his discernment was expressed in the choice of this important post.
 (80) From all sides, the scattered garrisons of the maritime cities and the mountains might repair with speed and safety to his <ORG>Imperial</ORG> standard.
 The natural fortifications of <GPE>Cilicia</GPE> protected, and even concealed, the camp of Heraclius, which was pitched near Issus, on the same ground where <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON> had vanquished the host of Darius.
 The angle which the emperor occupied was deeply indented into a vast semicircle of the Asiatic, Armenian, and <NORP>Syrian</NORP> provinces; and to whatsoever point of the circumference he should direct his attack, it was easy for him to dissemble his own motions, and to prevent those of the enemy.
 In the camp of Issus, the <NORP>Roman</NORP> general reformed the sloth and disorder of the veterans, and educated the new recruits in the knowledge and practice of military virtue.
 Unfolding the miraculous image of Christ, he urged them to revenge the holy altars which had been profaned by the worshippers of fire; addressing them by the endearing appellations of sons and brethren, he deplored the public and private wrongs of the republic.
 The subjects of a monarch were persuaded that they fought in the cause of freedom; and a similar enthusiasm was communicated to the foreign mercenaries, who must have viewed with equal indifference the interest of <GPE>Rome</GPE> and of Persia.
 <PERSON>Heraclius</PERSON> himself, with the skill and patience of a centurion, inculcated the lessons of the school of tactics, and the soldiers were assiduously trained in the use of their weapons, and the exercises and evolutions of the field.
 The cavalry and infantry in light or heavy armour were divided into <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> parties; the trumpets were fixed in the centre, and their signals directed the march, the charge, the retreat or pursuit; the direct or oblique order, the deep or extended phalanx; to represent in fictitious combat the operations of genuine war.
 Whatever hardships the emperor imposed on the troops, he inflicted with equal severity on himself; their labor, their diet, their sleep, were measured by the inflexible rules of discipline; and, without despising the enemy, they were taught to repose an implicit confidence in their own valour and the wisdom of their leader.
 <GPE>Cilicia</GPE> was soon encompassed with the <NORP>Persian</NORP> arms; but their cavalry hesitated to enter the defiles of Mount Taurus, till they were circumvented by the evolutions of Heraclius, who insensibly gained their rear, whilst he appeared to present his front in order of battle.
 By a false motion, which seemed to threaten Armenia, he drew them, against their wishes, to a general action.
 They were tempted by the artful disorder of his camp; but when they advanced to combat, the ground, the sun, and the expectation of both armies, were unpropitious to the Barbarians; the <NORP>Romans</NORP> successfully repeated their tactics in a field of battle, (81) and the event of the day declared to the world, that the <NORP>Persians</NORP> were not invincible, and that a hero was invested with the purple.
 Strong in victory and fame, <PERSON>Heraclius</PERSON> boldly ascended the heights of Mount Taurus, directed his march through the plains of Cappadocia, and established his troops, for the <DATE>winter</DATE> season, in safe and plentiful quarters on the banks of the River Halys.
 (82) His soul was superior to the vanity of entertaining <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> with an imperfect triumph; but the presence of the emperor was indispensably required to soothe the restless and rapacious spirit of the Avars.
 His <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> expedition, A.
D.
 623,624,625.
 Since the days of <PERSON>Scipio</PERSON> and Hannibal, no bolder enterprise has been attempted than that which <PERSON>Heraclius</PERSON> achieved for the deliverance of the empire (83) He permitted the <NORP>Persians</NORP> to oppress for a while the provinces, and to insult with impunity the capital of the East; while the <NORP>Roman</NORP> emperor explored his perilous way through the Black Sea, (84) and the mountains of Armenia, penetrated into the heart of Persia, (85) and recalled the armies of the great king to the defence of their bleeding country.
 With a select band of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> soldiers, <PERSON>Heraclius</PERSON> sailed from <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> to Trebizond; assembled his forces which had wintered in the <LOC>Pontic</LOC> regions; and, from the mouth of the <PRODUCT>Phasis</PRODUCT> to the <LOC>Caspian</LOC> Sea, encouraged his subjects and allies to march with the successor of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> under the faithful and victorious banner of the cross.
 When the legions of <PERSON>Lucullus</PERSON> and <PERSON>Pompey</PERSON> <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> passed the Euphrates, they blushed at their easy victory over the natives of Armenia.
 But the long experience of war had hardened the minds and bodies of that effeminate people; their zeal and bravery were approved in the service of a declining empire; they abhorred and feared the usurpation of the house of Sassan, and the memory of persecution envenomed their pious hatred of the enemies of Christ.
 The limits of Armenia, as it had been ceded to the emperor Maurice, extended as far as the Araxes: the river submitted to the indignity of a bridge, (86) and Heraclius, in the footsteps of Mark Antony, advanced towards the city of <GPE>Tauris</GPE> or Gandzaca, (87) the ancient and modern capital of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the provinces of Media.
 At the head of forty <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> men, <PERSON>Chosroes</PERSON> himself had returned from some distant expedition to oppose the progress of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> arms; but he retreated on the approach of Heraclius, declining the generous alternative of peace or of battle.
 Instead of half a million of inhabitants, which have been ascribed to <GPE>Tauris</GPE> under the reign of the Sophys, the city contained no more than <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> houses; but the value of the royal treasures was enhanced by a tradition, that they were the spoils of Croesus, which had been transported by <PERSON>Cyrus</PERSON> from the citadel of Sardes.
 The rapid conquests of <PERSON>Heraclius</PERSON> were suspended only by the <DATE>winter</DATE> season; a motive of prudence, or superstition, (88) determined his retreat into the province of Albania, along the shores of the Caspian; and his tents were most probably pitched in the plains of Mogan, (89) the favorite encampment of <NORP>Oriental</NORP> princes.
 In the course of this successful inroad, he signalized the zeal and revenge of a <NORP>Christian</NORP> emperor: at his command, the soldiers extinguished the fire, and destroyed the temples, of the Magi; the statues of Chosroes, who aspired to divine honours, were abandoned to the flames; and the ruins of <NORP>Thebarma</NORP> or Ormia, (90) which had given birth to <PERSON>Zoroaster</PERSON> himself, made some atonement for the injuries of the holy sepulchre.
 A purer spirit of religion was shown in the relief and deliverance of fifty <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> captives.
 <PERSON>Heraclius</PERSON> was rewarded by their tears and grateful acclamations; but this wise measure, which spread the fame of his benevolence, diffused the murmurs of the <NORP>Persians</NORP> against the pride and obstinacy of their own sovereign.
 Amidst the glories of the succeeding campaign, <PERSON>Heraclius</PERSON> is almost lost to our eyes, and to those of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> historians.
 (91) From the spacious and fruitful plains of Albania, the emperor appears to follow the chain of <NORP>Hyrcanian</NORP> Mountains, to descend into the province of <GPE>Media</GPE> or Irak, and to carry his victorious arms as far as the royal cities of <LOC>Casbin</LOC> and Ispahan, which had never been approached by a <NORP>Roman</NORP> conqueror.
 Alarmed by the danger of his kingdom, the powers of <PERSON>Chosroes</PERSON> were already recalled from the <LOC>Nile</LOC> and the Bosphorus, and <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> formidable armies surrounded, in a distant and hostile land, the camp of the emperor.
 The <NORP>Colchian</NORP> allies prepared to desert his standard; and the fears of the bravest veterans were expressed, rather than concealed, by their desponding silence.
 These magnanimous sentiments were supported by the vigour of his actions.
 He repelled the threefold attack of the Persians, improved the divisions of their chiefs, and, by a well-concerted train of marches, retreats, and successful actions, finally chased them from the field into the fortified cities of <GPE>Media</GPE> and Assyria.
 In the severity of the <DATE>winter</DATE> season, <PERSON>Sarbaraza</PERSON> deemed himself secure in the walls of Salban: he was surprised by the activity of Heraclius, who divided his troops, and performed a laborious march in the silence of the night.
 The flat roofs of the houses were defended with useless valour against the darts and torches of the Romans: the satraps and nobles of Persia, with their wives and children, and the flower of their martial youth, were either slain or made prisoners.
 The general escaped by a precipitate flight, but his golden armour was the prize of the conqueror; and the soldiers of <PERSON>Heraclius</PERSON> enjoyed the wealth and repose which they had so nobly deserved.
 On the return of spring, the emperor traversed in <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> days the mountains of Curdistan, and passed without resistance the rapid stream of the Tigris.
 Oppressed by the weight of their spoils and captives, the <NORP>Roman</NORP> army halted under the walls of Amida; and <PERSON>Heraclius</PERSON> informed the senate of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> of his safety and success, which they had already felt by the retreat of the besiegers.
 The bridges of the <LOC>Euphrates</LOC> were destroyed by the Persians; but as soon as the emperor had discovered a ford, they hastily retired to defend the banks of the Sarus, (92) in Cilicia.
 That river, an impetuous torrent, was about <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> feet broad; the bridge was fortified with strong turrets; and the banks were lined with <NORP>Barbarian</NORP> archers.
 After a bloody conflict, which continued till the evening, the <NORP>Romans</NORP> prevailed in the assault; and a <NORP>Persian</NORP> of gigantic size was slain and thrown into the <NORP>Sarus</NORP> by the hand of the emperor himself.
 The enemies were dispersed and dismayed; <PERSON>Heraclius</PERSON> pursued his march to <GPE>Sebaste</GPE> in Cappadocia; and at the expiration of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> years, the same coast of the <PRODUCT>Euxine</PRODUCT> applauded his return from a long and victorious expedition.
 (93) Deliverance of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> from the <NORP>Persians</NORP> and Avars, A.
D.
 626.
 Instead of skirmishing on the frontier, the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> monarchs who disputed the empire of the <LOC>East</LOC> aimed their desperate strokes at the heart of their rival.
 The military force of <GPE>Persia</GPE> was wasted by the marches and combats of twenty years, and many of the veterans, who had survived the perils of the sword and the climate, were still detained in the fortresses of <GPE>Egypt</GPE> and Syria.
 But the revenge and ambition of <PERSON>Chosroes</PERSON> exhausted his kingdom; and the new levies of subjects, strangers, and slaves, were divided into <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> formidable bodies.
 (94) The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> army of fifty <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> men, illustrious by the ornament and title of the golden spears, was destined to march against Heraclius; the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> was stationed to prevent his junction with the troops of his brother Theodorus; and the <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> was commanded to besiege Constantinople, and to <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> the operations of the chagan, with whom the <NORP>Persian</NORP> king had ratified a treaty of alliance and partition.
 Sarbar, the general of the <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> army, penetrated through the provinces of <LOC>Asia</LOC> to the well-known camp of Chalcedon, and amused himself with the destruction of the sacred and profane buildings of the <NORP>Asiatic</NORP> suburbs, while he impatiently waited the arrival of his <NORP>Scythian</NORP> friends on the opposite side of the Bosphorus.
 On the twenty-ninth of June, <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> Barbarians, the vanguard of the Avars, forced the long wall, and drove into the capital a promiscuous crowd of peasants, citizens, and soldiers.
 Fourscore <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> (95) of his native subjects, and of the vassal tribes of Gepidae, Russians, Bulgarians, and Sclavonians, advanced under the standard of the chagan; a month was spent in marches and negotiations, but the whole city was invested on the thirty-first of July, from the suburbs of <GPE>Pera</GPE> and <GPE>Galata</GPE> to the <GPE>Blachernae</GPE> and <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> towers; and the inhabitants descried with terror the flaming signals of the <NORP>European</NORP> and <NORP>Asiatic</NORP> shores.
 In the mean while, the magistrates of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> repeatedly strove to purchase the retreat of the chagan; but their deputies were rejected and insulted; and he suffered the patricians to stand before his throne, while the <NORP>Persian</NORP> envoys, in silk robes, were seated by his side.
 During ten successive days, the capital was assaulted by the Avars, who had made some progress in the science of attack; they advanced to sap or batter the wall, under the cover of the impenetrable tortoise; their engines discharged a perpetual volley of stones and darts; and <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> lofty towers of wood exalted the combatants to the height of the neighbouring ramparts.
 But the senate and people were animated by the spirit of Heraclius, who had detached to their relief a body of <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> cuirassiers; the powers of fire and mechanics were used with superior art and success in the defence of Constantinople; and the galleys, with <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> and <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> ranks of oars, commanded the Bosphorus, and rendered the <NORP>Persians</NORP> the idle spectators of the defeat of their allies.
 The <PERSON>Avars</PERSON> were repulsed; a fleet of <NORP>Sclavonian</NORP> canoes was destroyed in the harbour; the vassals of the chagan threatened to desert, his provisions were exhausted, and after burning his engines, he gave the signal of a slow and formidable retreat.
 The devotion of the <NORP>Romans</NORP> ascribed this signal deliverance to the Virgin Mary; but the mother of <PERSON>Christ</PERSON> would surely have condemned their inhuman murder of the <NORP>Persian</NORP> envoys, who were entitled to the rights of humanity, if they were not protected by the laws of nations.
 (97) Alliances and conquests of Heraclius.
 After the division of his army, <PERSON>Heraclius</PERSON> prudently retired to the banks of the Phasis, from whence he maintained a defensive war against the fifty <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> gold spears of Persia.
 His anxiety was relieved by the deliverance of Constantinople; his hopes were confirmed by a victory of his brother Theodorus; and to the hostile league of <PERSON>Chosroes</PERSON> with the Avars, the <NORP>Roman</NORP> emperor opposed the useful and honourable alliance of the Turks.
 At his liberal invitation, the horde of <PERSON>Chozars</PERSON> (98) transported their tents from the plains of the <LOC>Volga</LOC> to the mountains of Georgia; <PERSON>Heraclius</PERSON> received them in the neighbourhood of Teflis, and the khan with his nobles dismounted from their horses, if we may credit the Greeks, and fell prostrate on the ground, to adore the purple of the Caesars.
 Such voluntary homage and important aid were entitled to the warmest acknowledgments; and the emperor, taking off his own diadem, placed it on the head of the <NORP>Turkish</NORP> prince, whom he saluted with a tender embrace and the appellation of son.
 After a sumptuous banquet, he presented <PERSON>Ziebel</PERSON> with the plate and ornaments, the gold, the gems, and the silk, which had been used at the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> table, and, with his own hand, distributed rich jewels and ear-rings to his new allies.
 In a secret interview, he produced the portrait of his daughter Eudocia, (99) condescended to flatter the <NORP>Barbarian</NORP> with the promise of a fair and august bride; obtained an immediate succour of forty <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> horse, and negotiated a strong diversion of the <NORP>Turkish</NORP> arms on the side of the Oxus.
 (100) The Persians, in their turn, retreated with precipitation; in the camp of Edessa, <PERSON>Heraclius</PERSON> reviewed an army of seventy <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> <NORP>Romans</NORP> and strangers; and some months were successfully employed in the recovery of the cities of Syria, <GPE>Mesopotamia</GPE> and Armenia, whose fortifications had been imperfectly restored.
 <PERSON>Sarbar</PERSON> still maintained the important station of Chalcedon; but the jealousy of Chosroes, or the artifice of Heraclius, soon alienated the mind of that powerful satrap from the service of his king and country.
 A messenger was intercepted with a real or fictitious mandate to the cadarigan, or <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> in command, directing him to send, without delay, to the throne, the head of a guilty or unfortunate general.
 The despatches were transmitted to <PERSON>Sarbar</PERSON> himself; and as soon as he read the sentence of his own death, he dexterously inserted the names of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> officers, assembled a military council, and asked the <PERSON>Cadarigan</PERSON> whether he was prepared to execute the commands of their tyrant.
 The <NORP>Persians</NORP> unanimously declared, that <PERSON>Chosroes</PERSON> had forfeited the sceptre; a separate treaty was concluded with the government of Constantinople; and if some considerations of honour or policy restrained <PERSON>Sarbar</PERSON> from joining the standard of Heraclius, the emperor was assured that he might prosecute, without interruption, his designs of victory and peace.
 His <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> expedition, A.
D.
 627.
 Deprived of his firmest support, and doubtful of the fidelity of his subjects, the greatness of <PERSON>Chosroes</PERSON> was still conspicuous in its ruins.
 The number of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> may be interpreted as an <NORP>Oriental</NORP> metaphor, to describe the men and arms, the horses and elephants, that covered <GPE>Media</GPE> and <GPE>Assyria</GPE> against the invasion of Heraclius.
 Yet the <NORP>Romans</NORP> boldly advanced from the <NORP>Araxes</NORP> to the Tigris, and the timid prudence of <PERSON>Rhazates</PERSON> was content to follow them by forced marches through a desolate country, till he received a peremptory mandate to risk the fate of <GPE>Persia</GPE> in a decisive battle.
 Eastward of the Tigris, at the end of the bridge of Mosul, the great <GPE>Nineveh</GPE> had formerly been erected: (101) the city, and even the ruins of the city, had long since disappeared; (102) the vacant space afforded a spacious field for the operations of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> armies.
 But these operations are neglected by the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> historians, and, like the authors of epic poetry and romance, they ascribe the victory, not to the military conduct, but to the personal valour, of their favorite hero.
 and victories, December 1, etc.
 On this memorable day, Heraclius, on his horse Phallas, surpassed the bravest of his warriors: his lip was pierced with a spear; the steed was wounded in the thigh; but he carried his master safe and victorious through the triple phalanx of the Barbarians.
 In the heat of the action, <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> valiant chiefs were successively slain by the sword and lance of the emperor: among these was <PERSON>Rhazates</PERSON> himself; he fell like a soldier, but the sight of his head scattered grief and despair through the fainting ranks of the Persians.
 His armour of pure and massy gold, the shield of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and twenty plates, the sword and belt, the saddle and cuirass, adorned the triumph of Heraclius; and if he had not been faithful to <PERSON>Christ</PERSON> and his mother, the champion of <GPE>Rome</GPE> might have offered the <ORDINAL>fourth</ORDINAL> opime spoils to the <LOC>Jupiter</LOC> of the Capitol.
 (103) In the battle of Nineveh, which was fiercely fought from <TIME>daybreak</TIME> to the eleventh hour, <CARDINAL>twenty-eight</CARDINAL> standards, besides those which might be broken or torn, were taken from the Persians; the greatest part of their army was cut in pieces, and the victors, concealing their own loss, passed the night on the field.
 They acknowledged, that on this occasion it was less difficult to kill than to discomfit the soldiers of Chosroes; amidst the bodies of their friends, no more than <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> bow-shot from the enemy the remnant of the <NORP>Persian</NORP> cavalry stood firm till the seventh hour of the night; about the eighth hour they retired to their unrifled camp, collected their baggage, and dispersed on all sides, from the want of orders rather than of resolution.
 The diligence of <PERSON>Heraclius</PERSON> was not less admirable in the use of victory; by a march of forty-eight miles in four-and-twenty hours, his vanguard occupied the bridges of the great and the lesser Zab; and the cities and palaces of <GPE>Assyria</GPE> were open for the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> time to the Romans.
 By a just gradation of magnificent scenes, they penetrated to the royal seat of Dastagerd, and, though much of the treasure had been removed, and much had been expended, the remaining wealth appears to have exceeded their hopes, and even to have satiated their avarice.
 Whatever could not be easily transported, they consumed with fire, that <PERSON>Chosroes</PERSON> might feel the anguish of those wounds which he had so often inflicted on the provinces of the empire: and justice might allow the excuse, if the desolation had been confined to the works of regal luxury, if national hatred, military license, and religious zeal, had not wasted with equal rage the habitations and the temples of the guiltless subject.
 The recovery of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> <NORP>Roman</NORP> standards, and the deliverance of the numerous captives of <GPE>Edessa</GPE> and Alexandria, reflect a purer glory on the arms of Heraclius.
 From the palace of Dastagerd, he pursued his march within a few miles of <GPE>Modain</GPE> or Ctesiphon, till he was stopped, on the banks of the Arba, by the difficulty of the passage, the rigour of the season, and perhaps the fame of an impregnable capital.
 The return of the emperor is marked by the modern name of the city of Sherhzour: he fortunately passed Mount Zara, before the snow, which fell incessantly thirty-four days; and the citizens of Gandzca, or Tauris, were compelled to entertain the soldiers and their horses with a hospitable reception.
 (104) Flight of Chrosoes, A.
D.
 627, Dec.
 29.
 When the ambition of <PERSON>Chosroes</PERSON> was reduced to the defence of his hereditary kingdom, the love of glory, or even the sense of shame, should have urged him to meet his rival in the field.
 In the battle of Nineveh, his courage might have taught the <NORP>Persians</NORP> to vanquish, or he might have fallen with honour by the lance of a <NORP>Roman</NORP> emperor.
 The successor of <PERSON>Cyrus</PERSON> chose rather, at a secure distance, to expect the event, to assemble the relics of the defeat, and to retire, by measured steps, before the march of Heraclius, till he beheld with a sigh the once loved mansions of Dastagerd.
 Both his friends and enemies were persuaded, that it was the intention of <PERSON>Chosroes</PERSON> to bury himself under the ruins of the city and palace: and as both might have been equally adverse to his flight, the monarch of Asia, with Sira, and <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> concubines, escaped through a hole in the wall <CARDINAL>nine</CARDINAL> days before the arrival of the Romans.
 The slow and stately procession in which he showed himself to the prostrate crowd, was changed to a rapid and secret journey; and the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> <TIME>evening</TIME> he lodged in the cottage of a peasant, whose humble door would scarcely give admittance to the great king.
 (105) His superstition was subdued by fear: on the <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> day, he entered with joy the fortifications of Ctesiphon; yet he still doubted of his safety till he had opposed the River <LOC>Tigris</LOC> to the pursuit of the Romans.
 The discovery of his flight agitated with terror and tumult the palace, the city, and the camp of Dastagerd: the satraps hesitated whether they had most to fear from their sovereign or the enemy; and the females of the harem were astonished and pleased by the sight of mankind, till the jealous husband of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> wives again confined them to a more distant castle.
 At his command, the army of <GPE>Dastagerd</GPE> retreated to a new camp: the front was covered by the Arba, and a line of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> elephants; the troops of the more distant provinces successively arrived, and the vilest domestics of the king and satraps were enrolled for the last defence of the throne.
 It was still in the power of <PERSON>Chosroes</PERSON> to obtain a reasonable peace; and he was repeatedly pressed by the messengers of <PERSON>Heraclius</PERSON> to spare the blood of his subjects, and to relieve a humane conqueror from the painful duty of carrying fire and sword through the fairest countries of Asia.
 But the pride of the <NORP>Persian</NORP> had not yet sunk to the level of his fortune; he derived a momentary confidence from the retreat of the emperor; he wept with impotent rage over the ruins of his <NORP>Assyrian</NORP> palaces, and disregarded too long the rising murmurs of the nation, who complained that their lives and fortunes were sacrificed to the obstinacy of an old man.
 That unhappy old man was himself tortured with the sharpest pains both of mind and body; and, in the consciousness of his approaching end, he resolved to fix the tiara on the head of Merdaza, the most favoured of his sons.
 But the will of <PERSON>Chosroes</PERSON> was no longer revered, and Siroes, who gloried in the rank and merit of his mother Sira, had conspired with the malecontents to assert and anticipate the rights of primogeniture.
 (106) <CARDINAL>Twenty-two</CARDINAL> satraps (they styled themselves patriots) were tempted by the wealth and honours of a new reign: to the soldiers, the heir of <PERSON>Chosroes</PERSON> promised an increase of pay; to the Christians, the free exercise of their religion; to the captives, liberty and rewards; and to the nation, instant peace and the reduction of taxes.
 It was determined by the conspirators, that Siroes, with the ensigns of royalty, should appear in the camp; and if the enterprise should fail, his escape was contrived to the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> court.
 He is deposed, A.
D.
 628, February 25.
 But the new monarch was saluted with unanimous acclamations; the flight of <PERSON>Chosroes</PERSON> (yet where could he have fled?) was rudely arrested, <CARDINAL>eighteen</CARDINAL> sons were massacred before his face, and he was thrown into a dungeon, where he expired on the fifth day.
 The <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and modern <NORP>Persians</NORP> minutely describe how <PERSON>Chosroes</PERSON> was insulted, and famished, and tortured, by the command of an inhuman son, who so far surpassed the example of his father: but at the time of his death, what tongue would relate the story of the parricide? what eye could penetrate into the tower of darkness? According to the faith and mercy of his <NORP>Christian</NORP> enemies, he sunk without hope into a still deeper abyss; (107) and it will not be denied, that tyrants of every age and sect are the best entitled to such infernal abodes.
 and murdered by his son Siroes, February 28.
 The glory of the house of <PERSON>Sassan</PERSON> ended with the life of Chosroes: his unnatural son enjoyed only eight months the fruit of his crimes: and in the space of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> years, the regal title was assumed by <CARDINAL>nine</CARDINAL> candidates, who disputed, with the sword or dagger, the fragments of an exhausted monarchy.
 Every province, and each city of Persia, was the scene of independence, of discord, and of blood; and the state of anarchy prevailed about eight years longer, ! till the factions were silenced and united under the common yoke of the <NORP>Arabian</NORP> caliphs.
 (108) Treaty of peace between the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> empires, A.
D.
 628, March, etc.
 As soon as the mountains became passable, the emperor received the welcome news of the success of the conspiracy, the death of Chosroes, and the elevation of his eldest son to the throne of Persia.
 The authors of the revolution, eager to display their merits in the court or camp of Tauris, preceded the ambassadors of Siroes, who delivered the letters of their master to his brother the emperor of the Romans.
 (109) In the language of the usurpers of every age, he imputes his own crimes to the Deity, and, without degrading his equal majesty, he offers to reconcile the long discord of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> nations, by a treaty of peace and alliance more durable than brass or iron.
 The conditions of the treaty were easily defined and faithfully executed.
 In the recovery of the standards and prisoners which had fallen into the hands of the Persians, the emperor imitated the example of Augustus: their care of the national dignity was celebrated by the poets of the times, but the decay of genius may be measured by the distance between <PERSON>Horace</PERSON> and George of Pisidia: the subjects and brethren of <PERSON>Heraclius</PERSON> were redeemed from persecution, slavery, and exile; but, instead of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> eagles, the true wood of the holy cross was restored to the importunate demands of the successor of Constantine.
 The victor was not ambitious of enlarging the weakness of the empire; the son of <PERSON>Chosroes</PERSON> abandoned without regret the conquests of his father; the <NORP>Persians</NORP> who evacuated the cities of <GPE>Syria</GPE> and <GPE>Egypt</GPE> were honourably conducted to the frontier, and a war which had wounded the vitals of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> monarchies, produced no change in their external and relative situation.
 The return of <PERSON>Heraclius</PERSON> from <GPE>Tauris</GPE> to <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> was a perpetual triumph; and after the exploits of <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> glorious campaigns, he peaceably enjoyed the Sabbath of his toils.
 After a long impatience, the senate, the clergy, and the people, went forth to meet their hero, with tears and acclamations, with olive branches and innumerable lamps; he entered the capital in a chariot drawn by <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> elephants; and as soon as the emperor could disengage himself from the tumult of public joy, he tasted more genuine satisfaction in the embraces of his mother and his son.
 (110) The succeeding year was illustrated by a triumph of a very different kind, the restitution of the true cross to the holy sepulchre.
 <PERSON>Heraclius</PERSON> performed in person the pilgrimage of Jerusalem, the identity of the relic was verified by the discreet patriarch, (111) and this august ceremony has been commemorated by the <DATE>annual</DATE> festival of the exaltation of the cross.
 Before the emperor presumed to tread the consecrated ground, he was instructed to strip himself of the diadem and purple, the pomp and vanity of the world: but in the judgment of his clergy, the persecution of the <NORP>Jews</NORP> was more easily reconciled with the precepts of the gospel.
 He again ascended his throne to receive the congratulations of the ambassadors of <GPE>France</GPE> and India: and the fame of Moses, Alexander, and Hercules, (112) was eclipsed in the popular estimation, by the superior merit and glory of the great Heraclius.
 Yet the deliverer of the <LOC>East</LOC> was indigent and feeble.
 Of the <NORP>Persian</NORP> spoils, the most valuable portion had been expended in the war, distributed to the soldiers, or buried, by an unlucky tempest, in the waves of the Euxine.
 The conscience of the emperor was oppressed by the obligation of restoring the wealth of the clergy, which he had borrowed for their own defence: a perpetual fund was required to satisfy these inexorable creditors; the provinces, already wasted by the arms and avarice of the Persians, were compelled to a <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> payment of the same taxes; and the arrears of a simple citizen, the treasurer of Damascus, were commuted to a fine of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pieces of gold.
 The loss of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> soldiers (113) who had fallen by the sword, was of less fatal importance than the decay of arts, agriculture, and population, in this long and destructive war: and although a victorious army had been formed under the standard of Heraclius, the unnatural effort appears to have exhausted rather than exercised their strength.
 While the emperor triumphed at <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> or Jerusalem, an obscure town on the confines of <GPE>Syria</GPE> was pillaged by the Saracens, and they cut in pieces some troops who advanced to its relief; an ordinary and trifling occurrence, had it not been the prelude of a mighty revolution.
 These robbers were the apostles of Mahomet; their fanatic valour had emerged from the desert; and in the last eight years of his reign, <PERSON>Heraclius</PERSON> lost to the <NORP>Arabs</NORP> the same provinces which he had rescued from the Persians.
