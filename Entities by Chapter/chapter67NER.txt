Comparison of <GPE>Rome</GPE> and <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> The respective merits of <GPE>Rome</GPE> and <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> are compared and celebrated by an eloquent Greek, the father of the <NORP>Italian</NORP> schools.
 (1) The view of the ancient capital, the seat of his ancestors, surpassed the most sanguine expectations of Emanuel Chrysoloras; and he no longer blamed the exclamation of an old sophist, that <GPE>Rome</GPE> was the habitation, not of men, but of gods.
 Those gods, and those men, had long since vanished; but to the eye of liberal enthusiasm, the majesty of ruin restored the image of her ancient prosperity.
 The monuments of the consuls and Caesars, of the martyrs and apostles, engaged on all sides the curiosity of the philosopher and the Christian; and he confessed that in every age the arms and the religion of <GPE>Rome</GPE> were destined to reign over the earth.
 While <PERSON>Chrysoloras</PERSON> admired the venerable beauties of the mother, he was not forgetful of his native country, her fairest daughter, her <NORP>Imperial</NORP> colony; and the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> patriot expatiates with zeal and truth on the eternal advantages of nature, and the more transitory glories of art and dominion, which adorned, or had adorned, the city of Constantine.
 Yet the perfection of the copy still redounds (as he modestly observes) to the honour of the original, and parents are delighted to be renewed, and even excelled, by the superior merit of their children.
 <CARDINAL>Two</CARDINAL> strong and natural causes are alleged for the perfection of the model of new Rome.
 The royal founder reigned over the most illustrious nations of the globe; and in the accomplishment of his designs, the power of the <NORP>Romans</NORP> was combined with the art and science of the Greeks.
 Other cities have been reared to maturity by accident and time: their beauties are mingled with disorder and deformity; and the inhabitants, unwilling to remove from their natal spot, are incapable of correcting the errors of their ancestors, and the original vices of situation or climate.
 But the free idea of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> was formed and executed by a single mind; and the primitive model was improved by the obedient zeal of the subjects and successors of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> monarch.
 The adjacent isles were stored with an inexhaustible supply of marble; but the various materials were transported from the most remote shores of <LOC>Europe</LOC> and Asia; and the public and private buildings, the palaces, churches, aqueducts, cisterns, porticos, columns, baths, and hippodromes, were adapted to the greatness of the capital of the East.
 The superfluity of wealth was spread along the shores of <LOC>Europe</LOC> and Asia; and the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> territory, as far as the Euxine, the Hellespont, and the long wall, might be considered as a populous suburb and a perpetual garden.
 In this flattering picture, the past and the present, the times of prosperity and decay, are art fully confounded; but a sigh and a confession escape, from the orator, that his wretched country was the shadow and sepulchre of its former self.
 The works of ancient sculpture had been defaced by <NORP>Christian</NORP> zeal or <NORP>Barbaric</NORP> violence; the fairest structures were demolished; and the marbles of <GPE>Paros</GPE> or <LOC>Numidia</LOC> were burnt for lime, or applied to the meanest uses.
 Of many a statue, the place was marked by an empty pedestal; of many a column, the size was determined by a broken capital; the tombs of the emperors were scattered on the ground; the stroke of time was accelerated by storms and earthquakes; and the vacant space was adorned, by vulgar tradition, with fabulous monuments of gold and silver.
 From these wonders, which lived only in memory or belief, he distinguishes, however, the porphyry pillar, the column and colossus of Justinian, (3) and the church, more especially the dome, of St.
 Sophia; the best conclusion, since it could not be described according to its merits, and after it no other object could deserve to be mentioned.
 But he forgets that, a century before, the trembling fabrics of the colossus and the church had been saved and supported by the timely care of <PERSON>Andronicus</PERSON> the Elder.
 Thirty years after the emperor had fortified St.
 <PERSON>Sophia</PERSON> with <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> new buttresses or pyramids, the eastern hemisphere suddenly gave way: and the images, the altars, and the sanctuary, were crushed by the falling ruin.
 The mischief indeed was speedily repaired; the rubbish was cleared by the incessant labor of every rank and age; and the poor remains of riches and industry were consecrated by the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> to the most stately and venerable temple of the East.
 (4) The <NORP>Greek</NORP> schism after the council of Florence, A.
D.
 1440-1448.
 The last hope of the falling city and empire was placed in the harmony of the mother and daughter, in the maternal tenderness of Rome, and the filial obedience of Constantinople.
 In the synod of Florence, the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and <NORP>Latins</NORP> had embraced, and subscribed, and promised; but these signs of friendship were perfidious or fruitless; (5) and the baseless fabric of the union vanished like a dream.
 (6) The emperor and his prelates returned home in the <NORP>Venetian</NORP> galleys; but as they touched at the <PERSON>Morea</PERSON> and the Isles of Corfu and Lesbos, the subjects of the <NORP>Latins</NORP> complained that the pretended union would be an instrument of oppression.
 No sooner did they land on the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> shore, than they were saluted, or rather assailed, with a general murmur of zeal and discontent.
 During their absence, above <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> years, the capital had been deprived of its civil and ecclesiastical rulers; fanaticism fermented in anarchy; the most furious monks reigned over the conscience of women and bigots; and the hatred of the <NORP>Latin</NORP> name was the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> principle of nature and religion.
 Before his departure for Italy, the emperor had flattered the city with the assurance of a prompt relief and a powerful succour; and the clergy, confident in their orthodoxy and science, had promised themselves and their flocks an easy victory over the blind shepherds of the West.
 The double disappointment exasperated the Greeks; the conscience of the subscribing prelates was awakened; the hour of temptation was past; and they had more to dread from the public resentment, than they could hope from the favour of the emperor or the pope.
 Instead of justifying their conduct, they deplored their weakness, professed their contrition, and cast themselves on the mercy of God and of their brethren.
 To the reproachful question, what had been the event or the use of their <NORP>Italian</NORP> synod? they answered with sighs and tears, "Alas! we have made a new faith; we have exchanged piety for impiety; we have betrayed the immaculate sacrifice; and we are become Azymites.
" (The <PERSON>Azymites</PERSON> were those who celebrated the communion with unleavened bread; and I must retract or qualify the praise which I have bestowed on the growing philosophy of the times.
) "Alas! we have been seduced by distress, by fraud, and by the hopes and fears of a transitory life.
 The hand that has signed the union should be cut off; and the tongue that has pronounced the <NORP>Latin</NORP> creed deserves to be torn from the root.
" The best proof of their repentance was an increase of zeal for the most trivial rites and the most incomprehensible doctrines; and an absolute separation from all, without excepting their prince, who preserved some regard for honour and consistency.
 After the decease of the patriarch Joseph, the archbishops of <GPE>Heraclea</GPE> and <GPE>Trebizond</GPE> had courage to refuse the vacant office; and Cardinal Bessarion preferred the warm and comfortable shelter of the Vatican.
 The choice of the emperor and his clergy was confined to Metrophanes of Cyzicus: he was consecrated in St.
 Sophia, but the temple was vacant.
 The cross-bearers abdicated their service; the infection spread from the city to the villages; and Metrophanes discharged, without effect, some ecclesiastical thunders against a nation of schismatics.
 The eyes of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> were directed to <PERSON>Mark</PERSON> of Ephesus, the champion of his country; and the sufferings of the holy confessor were repaid with a tribute of admiration and applause.
 His example and writings propagated the flame of religious discord; age and infirmity soon removed him from the world; but the gospel of <PERSON>Mark</PERSON> was not a law of forgiveness; and he requested with his dying breath, that none of the adherents of <GPE>Rome</GPE> might attend his obsequies or pray for his soul.
 Zeal of the <NORP>Orientals</NORP> and <NORP>Russians</NORP> The schism was not confined to the narrow limits of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> empire.
 Secure under the <NORP>Mamaluke</NORP> sceptre, the <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> patriarchs of Alexandria, Antioch, and Jerusalem, assembled a numerous synod; disowned their representatives at <PERSON>Ferrara</PERSON> and Florence; condemned the creed and council of the Latins; and threatened the emperor of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> with the censures of the <NORP>Eastern</NORP> church.
 Of the sectaries of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> communion, the <NORP>Russians</NORP> were the most powerful, ignorant, and superstitious.
 Their primate, the cardinal Isidore, hastened from <GPE>Florence</GPE> to Moscow, (7) to reduce the independent nation under the <NORP>Roman</NORP> yoke.
 But the <NORP>Russian</NORP> bishops had been educated at Mount Athos; and the prince and people embraced the theology of their priests.
 They were scandalized by the title, the pomp, the <NORP>Latin</NORP> cross of the legate, the friend of those impious men who shaved their beards, and performed the divine office with gloves on their hands and rings on their fingers: <PERSON>Isidore</PERSON> was condemned by a synod; his person was imprisoned in a monastery; and it was with extreme difficulty that the cardinal could escape from the hands of a fierce and fanatic people.
 (8) The <NORP>Russians</NORP> refused a passage to the missionaries of <GPE>Rome</GPE> who aspired to convert the <NORP>Pagans</NORP> beyond the Tanais; (9) and their refusal was justified by the maxim, that the guilt of idolatry is less damnable than that of schism.
 The errors of the <NORP>Bohemians</NORP> were excused by their abhorrence for the pope; and a deputation of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> clergy solicited the friendship of those sanguinary enthusiasts.
 (10) While <PERSON>Eugenius</PERSON> triumphed in the union and orthodoxy of the Greeks, his party was contracted to the walls, or rather to the palace of Constantinople.
 The zeal of <NORP>Palaeologus</NORP> had been excited by interest; it was soon cooled by opposition: an attempt to violate the national belief might endanger his life and crown; not could the pious rebels be destitute of foreign and domestic aid.
 The sword of his brother Demetrius, who in <GPE>Italy</GPE> had maintained a prudent and popular silence, was <CARDINAL>half</CARDINAL> unsheathed in the cause of religion; and Amurath, the <NORP>Turkish</NORP> sultan, was displeased and alarmed by the seeming friendship of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and Latins.
 Reign and character of <PERSON>Amurath</PERSON> II.
 A.
D.
 1421-1451, February 9.
 This portrait is transcribed from the historian of the <NORP>Othman</NORP> empire: but the applause of a servile and superstitious people has been lavished on the worst of tyrants; and the virtues of a sultan are often the vices most useful to himself, or most agreeable to his subjects.
 A nation ignorant of the equal benefits of liberty and law, must be awed by the flashes of arbitrary power: the cruelty of a despot will assume the character of justice; his profusion, of liberality; his obstinacy, of firmness.
 If the most reasonable excuse be rejected, few acts of obedience will be found impossible; and guilt must tremble, where innocence cannot always be secure.
 The tranquillity of the people, and the discipline of the troops, were best maintained by perpetual action in the field; war was the trade of the Janizaries; and those who survived the peril, and divided the spoil, applauded the generous ambition of their sovereign.
 To propagate the true religion, was the duty of a faithful Mussulman: the unbelievers were his enemies, and those of the Prophet; and, in the hands of the Turks, the scimeter was the only instrument of conversion.
 Under these circumstances, however, the justice and moderation of <PERSON>Amurath</PERSON> are attested by his conduct, and acknowledged by the <NORP>Christians</NORP> themselves; who consider a prosperous reign and a peaceful death as the reward of his singular merits.
 In the vigour of his age and military power, he seldom engaged in war till he was justified by a previous and adequate provocation: the victorious sultan was disarmed by submission; and in the observance of treaties, his word was inviolate and sacred.
 (12) The <NORP>Hungarians</NORP> were commonly the aggressors; he was provoked by the revolt of Scanderbeg; and the perfidious <NORP>Caramanian</NORP> was twice vanquished, and twice pardoned, by the <NORP>Ottoman</NORP> monarch.
 Before he invaded the Morea, <PERSON>Thebes</PERSON> had been surprised by the despot: in the conquest of Thessalonica, the grandson of <PERSON>Bajazet</PERSON> might dispute the recent purchase of the Venetians; and after the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> siege of Constantinople, the sultan was never tempted, by the distress, the absence, or the injuries of Palaeologus, to extinguish the dying light of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> empire.
 His double abdication, A.
D.
 1442-1444.
 But the most striking feature in the life and character of <PERSON>Amurath</PERSON> is the double abdication of the <NORP>Turkish</NORP> throne; and, were not his motives debased by an alloy of superstition, we must praise the royal philosopher, (13) who at the age of <DATE>forty</DATE> could discern the vanity of human greatness.
 Resigning the sceptre to his son, he retired to the pleasant residence of Magnesia; but he retired to the society of saints and hermits.
 It was not till the <ORDINAL>fourth</ORDINAL> century of the Hegira, that the religion of <PERSON>Mahomet</PERSON> had been corrupted by an institution so adverse to his genius; but in the age of the crusades, the various orders of <PERSON>Dervises</PERSON> were multiplied by the example of the Christian, and even the Latin, monks.
 (14) The lord of nations submitted to fast, and pray, and turn round in endless rotation with the fanatics, who mistook the giddiness of the head for the illumination of the spirit.
 (15) But he was soon awakened from his dreams of enthusiasm by the <NORP>Hungarian</NORP> invasion; and his obedient son was the foremost to urge the public danger and the wishes of the people.
 Under the banner of their veteran leader, the <NORP>Janizaries</NORP> fought and conquered but he withdrew from the field of Varna, again to pray, to fast, and to turn round with his <NORP>Magnesian</NORP> brethren.
 These pious occupations were again interrupted by the danger of the state.
 A victorious army disdained the inexperience of their youthful ruler: the city of <PERSON>Adrianople</PERSON> was abandoned to rapine and slaughter; and the unanimous divan implored his presence to appease the tumult, and prevent the rebellion, of the Janizaries.
 At the well-known voice of their master, they trembled and obeyed; and the reluctant sultan was compelled to support his splendid servitude, till at the end of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> years, he was relieved by the angel of death.
 Age or disease, misfortune or caprice, have tempted several princes to descend from the throne; and they have had leisure to repent of their irretrievable step.
 But <PERSON>Amurath</PERSON> alone, in the full liberty of choice, after the trial of empire and solitude, has repeated his preference of a private life.
 <PERSON>Eugenius</PERSON> forms a league against the Turks, A.
D.
 1443.
 After the departure of his <NORP>Greek</NORP> brethren, <PERSON>Eugenius</PERSON> had not been unmindful of their temporal interest; and his tender regard for the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> empire was animated by a just apprehension of the Turks, who approached, and might soon invade, the borders of Italy.
 But the spirit of the crusades had expired; and the coldness of the <PERSON>Franks</PERSON> was not less unreasonable than their headlong passion.
 In the eleventh century, a fanatic monk could precipitate <LOC>Europe</LOC> on <LOC>Asia</LOC> for the recovery of the holy sepulchre; but in the fifteenth, the most pressing motives of religion and policy were insufficient to unite the <NORP>Latins</NORP> in the defence of Christendom.
 <GPE>Germany</GPE> was an inexhaustible storehouse of men and arms: (16) but that complex and languid body required the impulse of a vigorous hand; and <PERSON>Frederic</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>Third</ORDINAL> was alike impotent in his personal character and his <NORP>Imperial</NORP> dignity.
 A long war had impaired the strength, without satiating the animosity, of <GPE>France</GPE> and England: (17) but Philip duke of <GPE>Burgundy</GPE> was a vain and magnificent prince; and he enjoyed, without danger or expense, the adventurous piety of his subjects, who sailed, in a gallant fleet, from the coast of <GPE>Flanders</GPE> to the Hellespont.
 The maritime republics of <GPE>Venice</GPE> and <GPE>Genoa</GPE> were less remote from the scene of action; and their hostile fleets were associated under the standard of St.
 Peter.
 The kingdoms of <GPE>Hungary</GPE> and Poland, which covered as it were the interior pale of the <NORP>Latin</NORP> church, were the most nearly concerned to oppose the progress of the Turks.
 Arms were the patrimony of the <NORP>Scythians</NORP> and Sarmatians; and these nations might appear equal to the contest, could they point, against the common foe, those swords that were so wantonly drawn in bloody and domestic quarrels.
 But the same spirit was adverse to concord and obedience: a poor country and a limited monarch are incapable of maintaining a standing force; and the loose bodies of <NORP>Polish</NORP> and <NORP>Hungarian</NORP> horse were not armed with the sentiments and weapons which, on some occasions, have given irresistible weight to the <NORP>French</NORP> chivalry.
 Yet, on this side, the designs of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> pontiff, and the eloquence of Cardinal Julian, his legate, were promoted by the circumstances of the times: (18) by the union of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> crowns on the head of Ladislaus, (19) a young and ambitious soldier; by the valour of a hero, whose name, the name of John Huniades, was already popular among the Christians, and formidable to the Turks.
 An endless treasure of pardons and indulgences was scattered by the legate; many private warriors of <GPE>France</GPE> and <GPE>Germany</GPE> enlisted under the holy banner; and the crusade derived some strength, or at least some reputation, from the new allies both of <LOC>Europe</LOC> and Asia.
 A fugitive despot of <PERSON>Servia</PERSON> exaggerated the distress and ardour of the <NORP>Christians</NORP> beyond the Danube, who would unanimously rise to vindicate their religion and liberty.
 The <NORP>Greek</NORP> emperor, (20) with a spirit unknown to his fathers, engaged to guard the Bosphorus, and to sally from <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> at the head of his national and mercenary troops.
 The sultan of Caramania (21) announced the retreat of Amurath, and a powerful diversion in the heart of Anatolia; and if the fleets of the <LOC>West</LOC> could occupy at the same moment the <LOC>Straits</LOC> of the Hellespont, the <NORP>Ottoman</NORP> monarchy would be dissevered and destroyed.
 Heaven and earth must rejoice in the perdition of the miscreants; and the legate, with prudent ambiguity, instilled the opinion of the invisible, perhaps the visible, aid of the Son of God, and his divine mother.
 Ladislaus, king of <GPE>Poland</GPE> and Hungary, marches against them.
 Of the <NORP>Polish</NORP> and <NORP>Hungarian</NORP> diets, a religious war was the unanimous cry; and Ladislaus, after passing the Danube, led an army of his confederate subjects as far as Sophia, the capital of the <NORP>Bulgarian</NORP> kingdom.
 In this expedition they obtained <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> signal victories, which were justly ascribed to the valour and conduct of Huniades.
 In the first, with a vanguard of ten thousand men, he surprised the <NORP>Turkish</NORP> camp; in the second, he vanquished and made prisoner the most renowned of their generals, who possessed the double advantage of ground and numbers.
 The approach of winter, and the natural and artificial obstacles of Mount Haemus, arrested the progress of the hero, who measured a narrow interval of six days' march from the foot of the mountains to the hostile towers of Adrianople, and the friendly capital of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> empire.
 The retreat was undisturbed; and the entrance into <GPE>Buda</GPE> was at once a military and religious triumph.
 An ecclesiastical procession was followed by the king and his warriors on foot: he nicely balanced the merits and rewards of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> nations; and the pride of conquest was blended with the humble temper of Christianity.
 <CARDINAL>Thirteen</CARDINAL> bashaws, <CARDINAL>nine</CARDINAL> standards, and <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> thousand captives, were unquestionable trophies; and as all were willing to believe, and none were present to contradict, the crusaders multiplied, with unblushing confidence, the myriads of <NORP>Turks</NORP> whom they had left on the field of battle.
 (22) The <NORP>Turkish</NORP> Peace The most solid proof, and the most salutary consequence, of victory, was a deputation from the divan to solicit peace, to restore Servia, to ransom the prisoners, and to evacuate the <NORP>Hungarian</NORP> frontier.
 By this treaty, the rational objects of the war were obtained: the king, the despot, and <PERSON>Huniades</PERSON> himself, in the diet of Segedin, were satisfied with public and private emolument; a truce of ten years was concluded; and the followers of <PERSON>Jesus</PERSON> and Mahomet, who swore on the <WORK_OF_ART>Gospel</WORK_OF_ART> and the Koran, attested the word of God as the guardian of truth and the avenger of perfidy.
 In the place of the Gospel, the <NORP>Turkish</NORP> ministers had proposed to substitute the Eucharist, the real presence of the <NORP>Catholic</NORP> deity; but the <NORP>Christians</NORP> refused to profane their holy mysteries; and a superstitious conscience is less forcibly bound by the spiritual energy, than by the outward and visible symbols of an oath.
 (23) Violation of the peace, A.
D.
 1444.
 During the whole transaction, the cardinal legate had observed a sullen silence, unwilling to approve, and unable to oppose, the consent of the king and people.
 But the diet was not dissolved before <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> was fortified by the welcome intelligence, that <GPE>Anatolia</GPE> was invaded by the Caramanian, and <LOC>Thrace</LOC> by the <NORP>Greek</NORP> emperor; that the fleets of Genoa, Venice, and Burgundy, were masters of the Hellespont; and that the allies, informed of the victory, and ignorant of the treaty, of Ladislaus, impatiently waited for the return of his victorious army.
 This mischievous casuistry was seconded by his respectable character, and the levity of popular assemblies: war was resolved, on the same spot where peace had so lately been sworn; and, in the execution of the treaty, the <NORP>Turks</NORP> were assaulted by the Christians; to whom, with some reason, they might apply the epithet of Infidels.
 The falsehood of <PERSON>Ladislaus</PERSON> to his word and oath was palliated by the religion of the times: the most perfect, or at least the most popular, excuse would have been the success of his arms and the deliverance of the <NORP>Eastern</NORP> church.
 But the same treaty which should have bound his conscience had diminished his strength.
 On the proclamation of the peace, the <NORP>French</NORP> and <NORP>German</NORP> volunteers departed with indignant murmurs: the <NORP>Poles</NORP> were exhausted by distant warfare, and perhaps disgusted with foreign command; and their palatines accepted the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> license, and hastily retired to their provinces and castles.
 Even <GPE>Hungary</GPE> was divided by faction, or restrained by a laudable scruple; and the relics of the crusade that marched in the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> expedition were reduced to an inadequate force of twenty thousand men.
 A <NORP>Walachian</NORP> chief, who joined the royal standard with his vassals, presumed to remark that their numbers did not exceed the hunting retinue that sometimes attended the sultan; and the gift of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> horses of matchless speed might admonish <PERSON>Ladislaus</PERSON> of his secret foresight of the event.
 But the despot of Servia, after the restoration of his country and children, was tempted by the promise of new realms; and the inexperience of the king, the enthusiasm of the legate, and the martial presumption of <PERSON>Huniades</PERSON> himself, were persuaded that every obstacle must yield to the invincible virtue of the sword and the cross.
 After the passage of the Danube, <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> roads might lead to <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> and the Hellespont: the <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> direct, abrupt, and difficult through the mountains of Haemus; the other more tedious and secure, over a level country, and along the shores of the Euxine; in which their flanks, according to the <NORP>Scythian</NORP> discipline, might always be covered by a movable fortification of wagons.
 The latter was judiciously preferred: the <NORP>Catholics</NORP> marched through the plains of Bulgaria, burning, with wanton cruelty, the churches and villages of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> natives; and their last station was at Warna, near the sea-shore; on which the defeat and death of <PERSON>Ladislaus</PERSON> have bestowed a memorable name.
 (25) Battle of Warna, A.
D.
 1444, Nov.
 10.
 It was on this fatal spot, that, instead of finding a confederate fleet to <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> their operations, they were alarmed by the approach of <PERSON>Amurath</PERSON> himself, who had issued from his <NORP>Magnesian</NORP> solitude, and transported the forces of <LOC>Asia</LOC> to the defence of Europe.
 According to some writers, the <NORP>Greek</NORP> emperor had been awed, or seduced, to grant the passage of the Bosphorus; and an indelible stain of corruption is fixed on the Genoese, or the pope's nephew, the <NORP>Catholic</NORP> admiral, whose mercenary connivance betrayed the guard of the Hellespont.
 From Adrianople, the sultan advanced by hasty marches, at the head of sixty thousand men; and when the cardinal, and Huniades, had taken a nearer survey of the numbers and order of the Turks, these ardent warriors proposed the tardy and impracticable measure of a retreat.
 The king alone was resolved to conquer or die; and his resolution had almost been crowned with a glorious and salutary victory.
 The princes were opposite to each other in the centre; and the Beglerbegs, or generals of <GPE>Anatolia</GPE> and Romania, commanded on the right and left, against the adverse divisions of the despot and Huniades.
 The <NORP>Turkish</NORP> wings were broken on the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> onset: but the advantage was fatal; and the rash victors, in the heat of the pursuit, were carried away far from the annoyance of the enemy, or the support of their friends.
 When <PERSON>Amurath</PERSON> beheld the flight of his squadrons, he despaired of his fortune and that of the empire: a veteran <PERSON>Janizary</PERSON> seized his horse's bridle; and he had magnanimity to pardon and reward the soldier who dared to perceive the terror, and arrest the flight, of his sovereign.
 A copy of the treaty, the monument of <NORP>Christian</NORP> perfidy, had been displayed in the front of battle; and it is said, that the sultan in his distress, lifting his eyes and his hands to heaven, implored the protection of the God of truth; and called on the prophet <PERSON>Jesus</PERSON> himself to avenge the impious mockery of his name and religion.
 (26) With inferior numbers and disordered ranks, the king of <GPE>Hungary</GPE> rushed forward in the confidence of victory, till his career was stopped by the impenetrable phalanx of the Janizaries.
 If we may credit the <NORP>Ottoman</NORP> annals, his horse was pierced by the javelin of Amurath; (27) he fell among the spears of the infantry; and a <NORP>Turkish</NORP> soldier proclaimed with a loud voice, "Hungarians, behold the head of your king!" The death of <PERSON>Ladislaus</PERSON> was the signal of their defeat.
 On his return from an intemperate pursuit, <PERSON>Huniades</PERSON> deplored his error, and the public loss; he strove to rescue the royal body, till he was overwhelmed by the tumultuous crowd of the victors and vanquished; and the last efforts of his courage and conduct were exerted to save the remnant of his <NORP>Walachian</NORP> cavalry.
 Ten thousand <NORP>Christians</NORP> were slain in the disastrous battle of Warna: the loss of the Turks, more considerable in numbers, bore a smaller proportion to their total strength; yet the philosophic sultan was not ashamed to confess, that his ruin must be the consequence of a <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> and similar victory.
 At his command a column was erected on the spot where <PERSON>Ladislaus</PERSON> had fallen; but the modest inscription, instead of accusing the rashness, recorded the valour, and bewailed the misfortune, of the <NORP>Hungarian</NORP> youth.
 (28) The cardinal Julian.
 Before I lose sight of the field of Warna, I am tempted to pause on the character and story of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> principal actors, the cardinal <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> and John Huniades.
 <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> (29) <PERSON>Caesarini</PERSON> was born of a noble family of Rome: his studies had embraced both the <NORP>Latin</NORP> and <NORP>Greek</NORP> learning, both the sciences of divinity and law; and his versatile genius was equally adapted to the schools, the camp, and the court.
 No sooner had he been invested with the <NORP>Roman</NORP> purple, than he was sent into <GPE>Germany</GPE> to arm the empire against the rebels and heretics of Bohemia.
 The spirit of persecution is unworthy of a Christian; the military profession ill becomes a priest; but the former is excused by the times; and the latter was ennobled by the courage of Julian, who stood dauntless and alone in the disgraceful flight of the <NORP>German</NORP> host.
 As the pope's legate, he opened the council of Basil; but the president soon appeared the most strenuous champion of ecclesiastical freedom; and an opposition of seven years was conducted by his ability and zeal.
 After promoting the strongest measures against the authority and person of Eugenius, some secret motive of interest or conscience engaged him to desert on a sudden the popular party.
 The cardinal withdrew himself from <PERSON>Basil</PERSON> to Ferrara; and, in the debates of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and Latins, the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> nations admired the dexterity of his arguments and the depth of his theological erudition.
 (30) In his <NORP>Hungarian</NORP> embassy, we have already seen the mischievous effects of his sophistry and eloquence, of which <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> himself was the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> victim.
 The cardinal, who performed the duties of a priest and a soldier, was lost in the defeat of Warna.
 The circumstances of his death are variously related; but it is believed, that a weighty encumbrance of gold impeded his flight, and tempted the cruel avarice of some <NORP>Christian</NORP> fugitives.
 John <PERSON>Corvinus</PERSON> Huniades.
 From an humble, or at least a doubtful origin, the merit of John <PERSON>Huniades</PERSON> promoted him to the command of the <NORP>Hungarian</NORP> armies.
 His father was a Walachian, his mother a Greek: her unknown race might possibly ascend to the emperors of Constantinople; and the claims of the Walachians, with the surname of Corvinus, from the place of his nativity, might suggest a thin pretence for mingling his blood with the patricians of ancient Rome.
 (31) In his youth he served in the wars of Italy, and was retained, with <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> horsemen, by the bishop of Zagrab: the valour of the white knight (32) was soon conspicuous; he increased his fortunes by a noble and wealthy marriage; and in the defence of the <NORP>Hungarian</NORP> borders he won in the same year <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> battles against the Turks.
 By his influence, <PERSON>Ladislaus</PERSON> of <GPE>Poland</GPE> obtained the crown of Hungary; and the important service was rewarded by the title and office of <GPE>Waivod</GPE> of Transylvania.
 The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> of Julian's crusades added <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <NORP>Turkish</NORP> laurels on his brow; and in the public distress the fatal errors of <PERSON>Warna</PERSON> were forgotten.
 During the absence and minority of <PERSON>Ladislaus</PERSON> of Austria, the titular king, <PERSON>Huniades</PERSON> was elected supreme captain and governor of Hungary; and if envy at <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> was silenced by terror, a reign of <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> years supposes the arts of policy as well as of war.
 Yet the idea of a consummate general is not delineated in his campaigns; the white knight fought with the hand rather than the head, as the chief of desultory Barbarians, who attack without fear and fly without shame; and his military life is composed of a romantic alternative of victories and escapes.
 By the Turks, who employed his name to frighten their perverse children, he was corruptly denominated Jancus Lain, or the Wicked: their hatred is the proof of their esteem; the kingdom which he guarded was inaccessible to their arms; and they felt him most daring and formidable, when they fondly believed the captain and his country irrecoverably lost.
 Instead of confining himself to a defensive war, <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> years after the defeat of <PERSON>Warna</PERSON> he again penetrated into the heart of Bulgaria, and in the plain of Cossova, sustained, till the third day, the shock of the <NORP>Ottoman</NORP> army, <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> times more numerous than his own.
 As he fled alone through the woods of Walachia, the hero was surprised by <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> robbers; but while they disputed a gold chain that hung at his neck, he recovered his sword, slew the one, terrified the other, and, after new perils of captivity or death, consoled by his presence an afflicted kingdom.

 But the last and most glorious action of his life was the defence of <GPE>Belgrade</GPE> against the powers of <PERSON>Mahomet</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>Second</ORDINAL> in person.
 After a siege of <DATE>forty</DATE> days, the Turks, who had already entered the town, were compelled to retreat; and the joyful nations celebrated <PERSON>Huniades</PERSON> and <GPE>Belgrade</GPE> as the bulwarks of Christendom.
 (33) About a month after this great deliverance, the champion expired; and his most splendid epitaph is the regret of the <NORP>Ottoman</NORP> prince, who sighed that he could no longer hope for revenge against the single antagonist who had triumphed over his arms.
 On the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> vacancy of the throne, <PERSON>Matthias</PERSON> Corvinus, a youth of eighteen years of age, was elected and crowned by the grateful Hungarians.
 His reign was prosperous and long: <PERSON>Matthias</PERSON> aspired to the glory of a conqueror and a saint: but his purest merit is the encouragement of learning; and the <NORP>Latin</NORP> orators and historians, who were invited from <GPE>Italy</GPE> by the son, have shed the lustre of their eloquence on the father's character.

D.
 1404-1413, etc.
 In the list of heroes, John <PERSON>Huniades</PERSON> and <PERSON>Scanderbeg</PERSON> are commonly associated; (35) and they are both entitled to our notice, since their occupation of the <NORP>Ottoman</NORP> arms delayed the ruin of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> empire.
 John Castriot, the father of Scanderbeg, (36) was the hereditary prince of a small district of <PERSON>Epirus</PERSON> or Albania, between the mountains and the <LOC>Adriatic</LOC> Sea.
 Unable to contend with the sultan's power, <PERSON>Castriot</PERSON> submitted to the hard conditions of peace and tribute: he delivered his <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> sons as the pledges of his fidelity; and the <NORP>Christian</NORP> youths, after receiving the mark of circumcision, were instructed in the <NORP>Mahometan</NORP> religion, and trained in the arms and arts of <NORP>Turkish</NORP> policy.
 (37) The <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> elder brothers were confounded in the crowd of slaves; and the poison to which their deaths are ascribed cannot be verified or disproved by any positive evidence.
 Yet the suspicion is in a great measure removed by the kind and paternal treatment of George Castriot, the <ORDINAL>fourth</ORDINAL> brother, who, from his tender youth, displayed the strength and spirit of a soldier.
 The successive overthrow of a <NORP>Tartar</NORP> and <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> Persians, who carried a proud defiance to the <NORP>Turkish</NORP> court, recommended him to the favour of Amurath, and his <NORP>Turkish</NORP> appellation of Scanderbeg, (Iskender Beg,) or the lord Alexander, is an indelible memorial of his glory and servitude.
 His father's principality was reduced into a province; but the loss was compensated by the rank and title of Sanjiak, a command of five thousand horse, and the prospect of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> dignities of the empire.
 He served with honour in the wars of <LOC>Europe</LOC> and Asia; and we may smile at the art or credulity of the historian, who supposes, that in every encounter he spared the Christians, while he fell with a thundering arm on his <NORP>Mussulman</NORP> foes.
 The glory of <PERSON>Huniades</PERSON> is without reproach: he fought in the defence of his religion and country; but the enemies who applaud the patriot, have branded his rival with the name of traitor and apostate.
 In the eyes of the Christian, the rebellion of <PERSON>Scanderberg</PERSON> is justified by his father's wrongs, the ambiguous death of his <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> brothers, his own degradation, and the slavery of his country; and they adore the generous, though tardy, zeal, with which he asserted the faith and independence of his ancestors.
 But he had imbibed from his ninth year the doctrines of the Koran; he was ignorant of the Gospel; the religion of a soldier is determined by authority and habit; nor is it easy to conceive what new illumination at the age of <DATE>forty</DATE> (38) could be poured into his soul.
 His motives would be less exposed to the suspicion of interest or revenge, had he broken his chain from the moment that he was sensible of its weight: but a long oblivion had surely impaired his original right; and every year of obedience and reward had cemented the mutual bond of the sultan and his subject.
 If <PERSON>Scanderbeg</PERSON> had long harboured the belief of <NORP>Christianity</NORP> and the intention of revolt, a worthy mind must condemn the base dissimulation, that could serve only to betray, that could promise only to be forsworn, that could actively join in the temporal and spiritual perdition of so many thousands of his unhappy brethren.
 Shall we praise a secret correspondence with Huniades, while he commanded the vanguard of the <NORP>Turkish</NORP> army? shall we excuse the desertion of his standard, a treacherous desertion which abandoned the victory to the enemies of his benefactor? His revolt from the Turks, A.

 In the confusion of a defeat, the eye of <PERSON>Scanderbeg</PERSON> was fixed on the Reis Effendi or principal secretary: with the dagger at his breast, he extorted a firman or patent for the government of Albania; and the murder of the guiltless scribe and his train prevented the consequences of an immediate discovery.
 With some bold companions, to whom he had revealed his design he escaped in the night, by rapid marches, from the field or battle to his paternal mountains.
 The gates of <PERSON>Croya</PERSON> were opened to the royal mandate; and no sooner did he command the fortress, than George <PERSON>Castriot</PERSON> dropped the mask of dissimulation; abjured the prophet and the sultan, and proclaimed himself the avenger of his family and country.
 The names of religion and liberty provoked a general revolt: the Albanians, a martial race, were unanimous to live and die with their hereditary prince; and the <NORP>Ottoman</NORP> garrisons were indulged in the choice of martyrdom or baptism.
 In the assembly of the states of Epirus, <PERSON>Scanderbeg</PERSON> was elected general of the <NORP>Turkish</NORP> war; and each of the allies engaged to furnish his respective proportion of men and money.
 From these contributions, from his patrimonial estate, and from the valuable salt-pits of Selina, he drew an <DATE>annual</DATE> revenue of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> hundred thousand ducats; (39) and the entire sum, exempt from the demands of luxury, was strictly appropriated to the public use.
 His manners were popular; but his discipline was severe; and every superfluous vice was banished from his camp: his example strengthened his command; and under his conduct, the <NORP>Albanians</NORP> were invincible in their own opinion and that of their enemies.
 His valour, The bravest adventurers of <GPE>France</GPE> and <GPE>Germany</GPE> were allured by his fame and retained in his service: his standing militia consisted of eight thousand horse and seven thousand foot; the horses were small, the men were active; but he viewed with a discerning eye the difficulties and resources of the mountains; and, at the blaze of the beacons, the whole nation was distributed in the strongest posts.
 With such unequal arms <PERSON>Scanderbeg</PERSON> resisted twenty-three years the powers of the <NORP>Ottoman</NORP> empire; and <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> conquerors, <PERSON>Amurath</PERSON> the Second, and his greater son, were repeatedly baffled by a rebel, whom they pursued with seeming contempt and implacable resentment.
 At the head of sixty thousand horse and <DATE>forty</DATE> thousand Janizaries, <PERSON>Amurath</PERSON> entered Albania: he might ravage the open country, occupy the defenceless towns, convert the churches into mosques, circumcise the <NORP>Christian</NORP> youths, and punish with death his adult and obstinate captives: but the conquests of the sultan were confined to the petty fortress of Sfetigrade; and the garrison, invincible to his arms, was oppressed by a paltry artifice and a superstitious scruple.
 (40) <PERSON>Amurath</PERSON> retired with shame and loss from the walls of Croya, the castle and residence of the Castriots; the march, the siege, the retreat, were harassed by a vexatious, and almost invisible, adversary; (41) and the disappointment might tend to embitter, perhaps to shorten, the last days of the sultan.
 (42) In the fullness of conquest, <PERSON>Mahomet</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>Second</ORDINAL> still felt at his bosom this domestic thorn: his lieutenants were permitted to negotiate a truce; and the <NORP>Albanian</NORP> prince may justly be praised as a firm and able champion of his national independence.
 The enthusiasm of chivalry and religion has ranked him with the names of <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON> and Pyrrhus; nor would they blush to acknowledge their intrepid countryman: but his narrow dominion, and slender powers, must leave him at an humble distance below the heroes of antiquity, who triumphed over the <LOC>East</LOC> and the <NORP>Roman</NORP> legions.
 His splendid achievements, the bashaws whom he encountered, the armies that he discomfited, and the <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> thousand <NORP>Turks</NORP> who were slain by his single hand, must be weighed in the scales of suspicious criticism.
 Against an illiterate enemy, and in the dark solitude of Epirus, his partial biographers may safely indulge the latitude of romance: but their fictions are exposed by the light of <NORP>Italian</NORP> history; and they afford a strong presumption against their own truth, by a fabulous tale of his exploits, when he passed the <LOC>Adriatic</LOC> with eight hundred horse to the succour of the king of Naples.
 (43) Without disparagement to his fame, they might have owned, that he was finally oppressed by the <NORP>Ottoman</NORP> powers: in his extreme danger he applied to Pope Pius the <ORDINAL>Second</ORDINAL> for a refuge in the ecclesiastical state; And death, A.

 and his resources were almost exhausted, since <PERSON>Scanderbeg</PERSON> died a fugitive at Lissus, on the <NORP>Venetian</NORP> territory.
 (44) His sepulchre was soon violated by the <NORP>Turkish</NORP> conquerors; but the Janizaries, who wore his bones enchased in a bracelet, declared by this superstitious amulet their involuntary reverence for his valour.
 The instant ruin of his country may redound to the hero's glory; yet, had he balanced the consequences of submission and resistance, a patriot perhaps would have declined the unequal contest which must depend on the life and genius of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> man.
 <PERSON>Scanderbeg</PERSON> might indeed be supported by the rational, though fallacious, hope, that the pope, the king of Naples, and the <NORP>Venetian</NORP> republic, would join in the defence of a free and <NORP>Christian</NORP> people, who guarded the sea-coast of the Adriatic, and the narrow passage from <GPE>Greece</GPE> to Italy.
 His infant son was saved from the national shipwreck; the <PERSON>Castriots</PERSON> (45) were invested with a <NORP>Neapolitan</NORP> dukedom, and their blood continues to flow in the noblest families of the realm.
 A colony of <NORP>Albanian</NORP> fugitives obtained a settlement in Calabria, and they preserve at this day the language and manners of their ancestors.

 <CARDINAL>1</CARDINAL> — 1453, May 29.
 In the long career of the decline and fall of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire, I have reached at length the last reign of the princes of Constantinople, who so feebly sustained the name and majesty of the Caesars.
 On the decease of John Palaeologus, who survived about <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> years the <NORP>Hungarian</NORP> crusade, (47) the royal family, by the death of <PERSON>Andronicus</PERSON> and the monastic profession of Isidore, was reduced to <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> princes, Constantine, Demetrius, and Thomas, the surviving sons of the emperor Manuel.
 Of these the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> and the last were far distant in the Morea; but Demetrius, who possessed the domain of Selybria, was in the suburbs, at the head of a party: his ambition was not chilled by the public distress; and his conspiracy with the <NORP>Turks</NORP> and the schismatics had already disturbed the peace of his country.
 The funeral of the late emperor was accelerated with singular and even suspicious haste: the claim of <PERSON>Demetrius</PERSON> to the vacant throne was justified by a trite and flimsy sophism, that he was born in the purple, the eldest son of his father's reign.
 But the empress-mother, the senate and soldiers, the clergy and people, were unanimous in the cause of the lawful successor: and the despot Thomas, who, ignorant of the change, accidentally returned to the capital, asserted with becoming zeal the interest of his absent brother.
 An ambassador, the historian Phranza, was immediately despatched to the court of Adrianople.
 <PERSON>Amurath</PERSON> received him with honour and dismissed him with gifts; but the gracious approbation of the <NORP>Turkish</NORP> sultan announced his supremacy, and the approaching downfall of the <NORP>Eastern</NORP> empire.
 By the hands of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> illustrious deputies, the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> crown was placed at <GPE>Sparta</GPE> on the head of Constantine.
 In the spring he sailed from the Morea, escaped the encounter of a <NORP>Turkish</NORP> squadron, enjoyed the acclamations of his subjects, celebrated the festival of a new reign, and exhausted by his donatives the treasure, or rather the indigence, of the state.
 The emperor immediately resigned to his brothers the possession of the Morea; and the brittle friendship of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> princes, <PERSON>Demetrius</PERSON> and Thomas, was confirmed in their mother's presence by the frail security of oaths and embraces.
 His next occupation was the choice of a consort.
 A daughter of the doge of <GPE>Venice</GPE> had been proposed; but the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> nobles objected the distance between an hereditary monarch and an elective magistrate; and in their subsequent distress, the chief of that powerful republic was not unmindful of the affront.
 <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> afterwards hesitated between the royal families of <GPE>Trebizond</GPE> and Georgia; and the embassy of <PERSON>Phranza</PERSON> represents in his public and private life the last days of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> empire.
 (48) Embassies of Phranza, A.
D.
 1450-1452.
 The protovestiare, or great chamberlain, <PERSON>Phranza</PERSON> sailed from <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> as the minister of a bridegroom; and the relics of wealth and luxury were applied to his pompous appearance.
 His numerous retinue consisted of nobles and guards, of physicians and monks: he was attended by a band of music; and the term of his costly embassy was protracted above <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> years.
 On his arrival in <GPE>Georgia</GPE> or Iberia, the natives from the towns and villages flocked around the strangers; and such was their simplicity, that they were delighted with the effects, without understanding the cause, of musical harmony.
 Among the crowd was an old man, above a hundred years of age, who had formerly been carried away a captive by the Barbarians, (49) and who amused his hearers with a tale of the wonders of India, (50) from whence he had returned to <GPE>Portugal</GPE> by an unknown sea.
 (51) From this hospitable land, <PERSON>Phranza</PERSON> proceeded to the court of Trebizond, where he was informed by the <NORP>Greek</NORP> prince of the recent decease of Amurath.
 Instead of rejoicing in the deliverance, the experienced statesman expressed his apprehension, that an ambitious youth would not long adhere to the sage and pacific system of his father.
 After the sultan's decease, his <NORP>Christian</NORP> wife, Maria, (52) the daughter of the <NORP>Servian</NORP> despot, had been honourably restored to her parents; on the fame of her beauty and merit, she was recommended by the ambassador as the most worthy object of the royal choice; and <PERSON>Phranza</PERSON> recapitulates and refutes the specious objections that might be raised against the proposal.
 The majesty of the purple would ennoble an unequal alliance; the bar of affinity might be removed by liberal alms and the dispensation of the church; the disgrace of <NORP>Turkish</NORP> nuptials had been repeatedly overlooked; and, though the fair <PERSON>Maria</PERSON> was nearly fifty years of age, she might yet hope to give an heir to the empire.
 <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> listened to the advice, which was transmitted in the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> ship that sailed from Trebizond; but the factions of the court opposed his marriage; and it was finally prevented by the pious vow of the sultana, who ended her days in the monastic profession.
 Reduced to the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> alternative, the choice of <PERSON>Phranza</PERSON> was decided in favour of a <NORP>Georgian</NORP> princess; and the vanity of her father was dazzled by the glorious alliance.
 Instead of demanding, according to the primitive and national custom, a price for his daughter, (53) he offered a portion of fifty-six thousand, with an <DATE>annual</DATE> pension of five thousand, ducats; and the services of the ambassador were repaid by an assurance, that, as his son had been adopted in baptism by the emperor, the establishment of his daughter should be the peculiar care of the empress of Constantinople.
 On the return of Phranza, the treaty was ratified by the <NORP>Greek</NORP> monarch, who with his own hand impressed <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> vermilion crosses on the golden bull, and assured the <NORP>Georgian</NORP> envoy that in the spring his galleys should conduct the bride to her <NORP>Imperial</NORP> palace.
 State of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> court.
 But <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> embraced his faithful servant, not with the cold approbation of a sovereign, but with the warm confidence of a friend, who, after a long absence, is impatient to pour his secrets into the bosom of his friend.
 After laughing at his apprehensions, the emperor more gravely consoled him by the pleasing assurance that this should be his last service abroad, and that he destined for his son a wealthy and noble heiress; for himself, the important office of great logothete, or principal minister of state.
 The marriage was immediately stipulated: but the office, however incompatible with his own, had been usurped by the ambition of the admiral.
 Some delay was requisite to negotiate a consent and an equivalent; and the nomination of <PERSON>Phranza</PERSON> was <CARDINAL>half</CARDINAL> declared, and <CARDINAL>half</CARDINAL> suppressed, lest it might be displeasing to an insolent and powerful favourite.
 The <DATE>winter</DATE> was spent in the preparations of his embassy; and <PERSON>Phranza</PERSON> had resolved, that the youth his son should embrace this opportunity of foreign travel, and be left, on the appearance of danger, with his maternal kindred of the Morea.
 Such were the private and public designs, which were interrupted by a <NORP>Turkish</NORP> war, and finally buried in the ruins of the empire.
