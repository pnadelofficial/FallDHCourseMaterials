 blindness of ambition, that, when Paul was expelled on a
 charge of murder, he solicited, with a bribe of seven
 hundred pounds of gold, his restoration to the same station
 of hatred and ignominy.","('Paul', 'PERSON'), ('seven\r\n hundred pounds', 'QUANTITY')"
"Yet the
 modern natives of Armenia and Abyssinia would be incapable

"Yet the body of the
 people, both in Syria and Egypt, still persevered in the use
 of their national idioms; with this difference, however,
 that the Coptic was confined to the rude and illiterate
 peasants of the Nile, while the Syriac, (110) from the
 mountains of Assyria to the Red Sea, was adapted to the
 higher topics of poetry and argument.","('Syria', 'GPE'), ('Egypt', 'GPE'), ('Coptic', 'NORP'), ('Nile', 'LOC'), ('Syriac', 'NORP'), ('110', 'CARDINAL'), ('Assyria', 'GPE'), ('the Red Sea', 'LOC')"

 project of a Latin council: he disdained to preside in the
 Greek synod, which was speedily assembled at Nice in
 Bithynia; his legates required in a peremptory tone the
