"Under these circumstances,
 however, the justice and moderation of Amurath are attested
 by his conduct, and acknowledged by the Christians

"Violation of the peace, A.D. 1444.","('A.D. 1444', 'DATE')"
"When Amurath beheld the
 flight of his squadrons, he despaired of his fortune and
 that of the empire: a veteran Janizary seized his horse's
 bridle; and he had magnanimity to pardon and reward the
 soldier who dared to perceive the terror, and arrest the
 flight, of his sovereign.","('Amurath', 'PERSON'), ('Janizary', 'PERSON')"
"While
 Chrysoloras admired the venerable beauties of the mother, he
 was not forgetful of his native country, her fairest
 daughter, her Imperial colony; and the Byzantine patriot
 expatiates with zeal and truth on the eternal advantages of
 nature, and the more transitory glories of art and dominion,
 which adorned, or had adorned, the city of Constantine.","('Chrysoloras', 'PERSON'), ('Imperial', 'NORP'), ('Byzantine', 'NORP'), ('Constantine', 'GPE')"

 victory, till his career was stopped by the impenetrable
 phalanx of the Janizaries.","('Hungary', 'GPE'), ('Janizaries', 'NORP')"
"With such unequal arms Scanderbeg resisted twenty-three years the powers of the Ottoman empire; and two conquerors, Amurath the Second, and his greater son, were repeatedly baffled by a rebel, whom they pursued with seeming contempt and implacable resentment.","('Scanderbeg', 'PERSON'), ('twenty-three years', 'DATE'), ('Ottoman', 'NORP'), ('two', 'CARDINAL'), ('Amurath', 'PERSON'), ('Second', 'ORDINAL')"
"Without disparagement to his fame, they might have owned,
