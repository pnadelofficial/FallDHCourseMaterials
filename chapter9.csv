 Europe, Africa, and Asia; and (to use the author's metaphor)
 the blood circulated from the extremities to the heart.","('Europe', 'LOC'), ('Africa', 'LOC'), ('Asia', 'LOC')"
"The only temples in Germany were dark and ancient groves,
 consecrated by the reverence of succeeding generations.","('Germany', 'GPE')"

"The severity of a winter
 campaign, that chilled the courage of the Roman troops, was

 Italian sun.  (11)

 united effort.","('Germany', 'GPE')"
"The truce of God, so often and so ineffectually
 proclaimed by the clergy of the eleventh century, was an
 obvious imitation of this ancient custom.  (66)

 But the influence of religion was far more powerful to
 inflame than to moderate the fierce passions of the Germans.","('the eleventh century', 'DATE'), ('Germans', 'NORP')"
"The unknown symbol
 of the Earth, covered with a thick veil, was placed on a
 carriage drawn by cows; and in this manner the goddess,
 whose common residence was in the isle of Rugen, visited
 several adjacent tribes of her worshippers.","('Earth', 'LOC'), ('Rugen', 'PERSON')"
"The various
 transactions of peace and war had introduced some Roman
 coins (chiefly silver) among the borderers of the Rhine and
 Danube; but the more distant tribes were absolutely
 unacquainted with the use of money, carried on their
 confined traffic by the exchange of commodities, and prized
 their rude earthen vessels as of equal value with the silver
 vases, the presents of Rome to their princes and
 ambassadors.   (28)","('Roman', 'NORP'), ('Rhine', 'LOC'), ('Danube', 'LOC'), ('Rome', 'GPE'), ('28', 'CARDINAL')"
"The view of arms and of danger heightened
 the effect of the military song; and the passions which it
 tended to excite, the desire of fame and the contempt of
 death, were the habitual sentiments of a German mind.  (71)","('German', 'NORP'), ('71', 'CARDINAL')"
"The wide extent of country might very
 possibly contain a million of warriors, as all who were of
 age to bear arms were of a temper to use them.","('million', 'CARDINAL')"
"Their edifices were not even
 contiguous, or formed into regular villages;   (22) each
 barbarian fixed his independent dwelling on the spot to
 which a plain, a wood or a stream of fresh water had induced
 him to give the preference.","('22', 'CARDINAL')"
"Their monstrous herds
 of cattle, less remarkable indeed for their beauty than for
 their utility,  (26) formed the principal object of their
 wealth.","('26', 'CARDINAL')"
"Their progress was checked by their want of
 arms and discipline, and their fury was diverted by the
 intestine divisions of ancient Germany.","('Germany', 'GPE')"
"Their secret gloom, the imagined residence of an invisible
 power, by presenting no distinct object of fear or worship,
 impressed the mind with a still deeper sense of religious
 horror;  (63) and the priests, rude and illiterate as they
 were, had been taught by experience the use of every
 artifice that could preserve and fortify impressions so well
 suited to their own interest.","('63', 'CARDINAL')"
"Their taste for strong liquors
 Strong beer, a liquor extracted with very little art from
 wheat or barley, and corrupted (as it is strongly expressed
 by Tacitus) into a certain semblance of wine, was sufficient

"These conditions are,
 however, very repugnant to the maxims of the ancient
 Germans, who delighted in mutual presents; but without
 either imposing, or accepting, the weight of obligations.  (55)
German chastity
""In the days of chivalry, or more properly of romance, all
 the men were brave, and all the women were chaste ;""  and notwithstanding the latter of these virtues is acquired and preserved with much more difficulty than the former, it is ascribed, almost without exception, to the wives of the ancient Germans.","('Germans', 'NORP'), ('German', 'NORP'), ('Germans', 'NORP')"

 attempted not, however (as has since been executed with so
 much success), to naturalise the vine on the banks of the
 Rhine and Danube; nor did they endeavour to procure by
 industry the materials of an advantageous commerce.","('Rhine', 'LOC'), ('Danube', 'LOC')"

"This institution, however it might accidentally weaken the several republics, invigorated the general character of the Germans, and even

 susceptible; the faith and valour, the hospitality and the
 courtesy, so conspicuous long afterwards in the ages of
 chivalry.","('Germans', 'NORP')"
"Though the horses of Germany were neither
 beautiful, swift, nor practised in the skilful evolutions of
 the Roman manege, several of the nations obtained renown by
 their cavalry; but, in general, the principal strength of
 the Germans consisted in their infantry,  (73) which was drawn
 up in several deep columns, according to the distinction of
tribes and families.","('Germany', 'GPE'), ('Roman', 'NORP'), ('Germans', 'NORP'), ('73', 'CARDINAL')"

"We
 may assert, with greater confidence, that the keen air of
 Germany formed the large and masculine limbs of the natives,
 who were, in general, of a more lofty stature than the
 people of the South,   (9) gave them a kind of strength better
 adapted to violent exertions than to patient labour, and
 inspired them with constitutional bravery, which is the
 result of nerves and spirits.","('Germany', 'GPE'), ('South', 'LOC'), ('9', 'CARDINAL')"
"We are only
 at a loss to conceive by what means riches and despotism
 could penetrate into a remote corner of the North, and
 extinguish the generous flame that blazed with such
 fierceness on the frontier of the Roman provinces: or how
 the ancestors of those Danes and Norwegians, so
 distinguished in latter ages by their unconquered spirit,
 could thus tamely resign the great character of German
 liberty.  (42)","('North', 'LOC'), ('Roman', 'NORP'), ('Danes', 'NORP'), ('Norwegians', 'NORP'), ('German', 'NORP'), ('42', 'CARDINAL')"
"We may allow with safety, and perhaps
 with truth, that ancient Germany was not originally peopled
 by any foreign colonies already formed into a political
 society;  (12) but that the name and nation received their
 existence from the gradual union of some wandering savages

"We may easily discover that Tacitus indulges an honest pleasure in the contrast of barbarian virtue with the dissolute conduct of the Roman ladies; yet there are

 the Germans.","('Tacitus', 'PERSON'), ('Roman', 'NORP'), ('Germans', 'NORP')"

"When we recollect the complete armour of the Roman soldiers,
 their discipline, exercises, evolutions, fortified camps,
 and military engines, it appears a just matter of surprise

 dare to encounter in the field the strength of the legions,
 and the various troops of the auxiliaries which seconded
 their operations.","('Roman', 'NORP')"
