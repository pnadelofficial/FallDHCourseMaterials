"When Disabul led his armies against the frontiers
 of Persia, his Roman allies followed many days the march of
 the Turkish camp, nor were they dismissed till they had
 enjoyed their precedency over the envoy of the great king,
 whose loud and intemperate clamours interrupted the silence
 of the royal banquet.","('Disabul', 'PERSON'), ('Persia', 'LOC'), ('Roman', 'NORP'), ('many days', 'DATE'), ('Turkish', 'NORP')"
"When Isdigune had saluted the emperor, and

"Whenever they were obedient, he could lead a
 numerous army into the field; but some faith is requisite to

"While Chosroes pursued his ambitious designs on
 the coast of the Euxine, Belisarius, at the head of an army
 without pay or discipline, encamped beyond the Euphrates,
 within six miles of Nisibis.","('Chosroes', 'PERSON'), ('Euxine', 'LOC'), ('Belisarius', 'PERSON'), ('Euphrates', 'LOC'), ('six miles', 'QUANTITY'), ('Nisibis', 'GPE')"
"While the lieutenant of Justinian subdued the kingdoms of the Goths and Vandals, the emperor, (5) timid, though ambitious, balanced the forces of the Barbarians, fomented their divisions by flattery and falsehood, and invited by his patience and liberality the repetition of injuries.

"While the successor of Disabul celebrated his
 father's obsequies, he was saluted by the ambassadors of the
 emperor Tiberius, who proposed an invasion of Persia, and
 sustained, with firmness, the angry and perhaps the just
 reproaches of that haughty Barbarian.","('Disabul', 'PERSON'), ('Tiberius', 'PERSON'), ('Persia', 'GPE'), ('Barbarian', 'NORP')"
"With a similar design, to
 admonish kings that they are strong only in the strength of
 their subjects, the same Indians invented the game of chess,

 Nushirvan. (56)","('Indians', 'NORP'), ('Persia', 'GPE'), ('Nushirvan', 'PERSON'), ('56', 'CARDINAL')"
"Without
 distinction of rank, or age, or sex, the captives were
 impaled or flayed alive, or suspended between four posts,
 and beaten with clubs till they expired, or enclosed in some
 spacious building, and left to perish in the flames with the
 spoil and cattle which might impede the march of these
 savage victors. (20)","('between four', 'CARDINAL'), ('20', 'CARDINAL')"
"Yet
 this diversion had already succeeded in forcing Chosroes to
 return with loss and precipitation; and if the skill of
 Belisarius had been seconded by discipline and valour, his
 success might have satisfied the sanguine wishes of the
 public, who required at his hands the conquest of Ctesiphon,
 and the deliverance of the captives of Antioch.","('Chosroes', 'NORP'), ('Belisarius', 'PERSON'), ('Ctesiphon', 'GPE'), ('Antioch', 'GPE')"
"Yet he accepted this gift like the gold and ebony of India, the frankincense of the Arabs, or the negroes and ivory of Aethiopia: the Colchians were not subject to the dominion of a satrap, and they continued to enjoy the name as well as substance of national independence.

 the spirit of freedom and the subtilties of philosophic
 disquisition.","('Greek', 'NORP'), ('Plato', 'PERSON'), ('Aristotle', 'PERSON')"
"Yet the herd of twelve thousand captives was ransomed for two
 hundred pounds of gold; the neighbouring bishop of Sergiopolis pledged his faith for the payment: and in the subsequent year the unfeeling avarice of Chosroes exacted the penalty of an obligation which it was generous to contract and impossible to discharge.","('twelve thousand', 'CARDINAL'), ('two\r\n hundred pounds', 'QUANTITY'), ('Sergiopolis', 'GPE'), ('the subsequent year', 'DATE'), ('Chosroes', 'PERSON')"

 efforts of its inhabitants.","('Chosroes', 'PERSON'), ('the Colchian war', 'EVENT')"
"Yet the repeated labours of Isdigune could procure only a
 partial and imperfect truce, which was always purchased with
