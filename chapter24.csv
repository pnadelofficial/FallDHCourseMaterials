 conducting the funeral.","('129', 'CARDINAL'), ('Procopius', 'PERSON')"
"Without adopting in 
 its full force this malicious insinuation, we must
 acknowledge that the conclusion of so ignominious a treaty

"Without being conspicuous for any of the ambitious qualifications which excite the admiration and
 envy of mankind, the comely person of Jovian, his cheerful

 arts of their enemies.","('Jovian', 'PERSON')"

 enemy's country.","('sixty thousand', 'CARDINAL'), ('one', 'CARDINAL')"
"Yielding at length to
 their clamorous importunities, he consented, with
 reluctance, that five hundred Gauls and Germans, accustomed
 from their infancy to the waters of the Rhine and Danube,

 as an encouragement or as a warning for the rest of the
 army.","('five hundred', 'CARDINAL'), ('Gauls', 'NORP'), ('Germans', 'NORP'), ('Rhine', 'LOC'), ('Danube', 'LOC')"
