 remains of his deceased sovereign;(129) and Procopius, who 
 sincerely bewailed the loss of his kinsman, was removed from
 the command of the army, under the decent pretence of
 conducting the funeral.","('129', 'CARDINAL'), ('Procopius', 'PERSON')"
"Without adopting in 
 its full force this malicious insinuation, we must
 acknowledge that the conclusion of so ignominious a treaty
 was facilitated by the private ambition of Jovian.","('Jovian', 'PERSON')"
"Without being conspicuous for any of the ambitious qualifications which excite the admiration and
 envy of mankind, the comely person of Jovian, his cheerful
 temper, and familiar wit, had gained the affection of his
 fellow soldiers and the generals of both parties acquiesced
 in a popular election which had not been conducted by the
 arts of their enemies.","('Jovian', 'PERSON')"
"Yet Julian enjoyed the
 satisfaction of embracing a philosopher and a friend, whose
 religious firmness had withstood the pressing and repeated
 solicitations of Constantius and Gallus as often as those
 princes lodged at his house in their passage through
 Hierapolis.","('Julian', 'PERSON'), ('Constantius', 'PERSON'), ('Gallus', 'PERSON'), ('Hierapolis', 'PERSON')"
"Yet the prudence of the emperor induced him to secure a remote frontier, perpetually
 exposed to the inroads of the hostile Arabs.","('Arabs', 'NORP')"
"Yet the sophist of Antioch
 sometimes descended from this imaginary elevation; he
 entertained a various and elaborate correspondence;(26) he 
 praised the virtues of his own times; he boldly arraigned
 the abuses of public and private life; and he eloquently
 pleaded the cause of Antioch against the just resentment of
 Julian and Theodosius.","('Antioch', 'GPE'), ('26', 'CARDINAL'), ('Antioch', 'GPE'), ('Julian', 'PERSON'), ('Theodosius', 'PERSON')"
"Yet there are not wanting some 
 specious, and perhaps solid, reasons, which might justify
 the resolution of Julian.","('Julian', 'PERSON')"
"Yet, in every age, 
 the subsistence of sixty thousand men must have been one of
 the most important cares of a prudent general; and that
 subsistence could only be drawn from his own or from the
 enemy's country.","('sixty thousand', 'CARDINAL'), ('one', 'CARDINAL')"
"Yielding at length to
 their clamorous importunities, he consented, with
 reluctance, that five hundred Gauls and Germans, accustomed
 from their infancy to the waters of the Rhine and Danube,
 should attempt the bold adventure, which might serve either
 as an encouragement or as a warning for the rest of the
 army.","('five hundred', 'CARDINAL'), ('Gauls', 'NORP'), ('Germans', 'NORP'), ('Rhine', 'LOC'), ('Danube', 'LOC')"
